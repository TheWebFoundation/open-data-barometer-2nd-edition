Today the registration of land is arranged in such a way that the new number of the property is registered in the database of the National Registry of Iceland and the ownership is the same as the prior registered owner of the land. This file is a text file and it is possible to buy the data. 
Statistics Iceland also defines land properties in a spatial database. The ownership of land is not part of these data, but it is possible to connect the demarcation of land to the registration of ownership. You can buy this dataset from Statistics Iceland. In the near future it is possible that data on land assets/properties (i.e. excluding the registration of ownership ) will be made available on opingogn.is
It is also possible to connect access address data to the ownership of land in the same way, there is a list of landowners down on each access address.
The ownership of land is not a part of the open records, partly because of privacy but additionally because Registers Iceland depends on their income from selling data. If, therefore, the register of land assets will be made available on opingogn.is the ownership of the land will not be part of the data.

There is no national procurement agency or the like. Though, there are central information sources and databases for companies to search for tenders (1). There is a public procurement portal managed by the Japan External Trade Organization but there is no data on awarded contracts (2). Some Ministries provide awarded contracts information on their website. We could find such data on the following ones: Ministry of Education, Culture, Science, Sports and Technology (3), Ministry of Environment (4), Ministry of Foreign Affairs (5) and Ministry of Defense (6).

This finding is also supported by Open Knowledge Foundation at https://index.okfn.org/country/Portugal/budget/

According to the World Bank, Portugal has a grade B practice in disclosing open budget data (table 3.1 at 
http://siteresources.worldbank.org/PUBLICSECTORANDGOVERNANCE/Resources/285741-1303321730709/FMIS-and-OBD_eng.pdf )but in the government's website only non-open data could be found which creates an inconsistency.

The Central Department of Statistics and Information (CDSI) also has some information on health but it seems outdated (latest available is for 2009).

""There is currently no system of registration of titles in Sierra Leone. The Registration of Instruments Act, Cap 256 of the Laws of Sierra Leone 1960 created a system of registration of instruments of conveyance. In this system, it is the conveyance itself which confers title, not the registration of the instruments under which the conveyance was executed"" (2).

SAAQIS, provides a common platform for managing air quality information in South Africa. It makes data available to stakeholders including the public and provides a mechanism to ensure uniformity in the way air quality data is managed i.e. captured, stored, validated, analysed and reported on in South Africa.

There is also data on the Environment GIS website and it is provided in form of Maps and graphics. It is a GIS inventory of all protected and conservation areas in South Africa. The database, which is currently being developed, will eventually also include data on privately owned protected areas. The database distinguishes between various types and sub-types of protected areas and conservation areas. Protected area types include: National Parks, Nature Reserves, Special Nature Reserves, Mountain Catchment Areas, World Heritage Sites Protected Environments, Forest Nature Reserves, Forest Wilderness Areas, Specially Protected Forest Areas and Marine Protected Areas.

(A side note on sustainability of data.gov.uk: At a first look, http://data.gov.uk/dataset/quarterly_national_accounts for the GDP appears as a bulk download possibility. However, the overview site does not lead to data, but to archived ONS sites. Access to data is only possible for the recent 2 years (until  Q4 2011) - yet most of the data is covered in the most recent version of the quarterly views of the GDP.)","As selecting proper datasets in this area involves searching and looking through a lot of statistics, it was a bit difficult. For instance, data.gov.uk doesn't deliver any direct data links when looking for 'census 2011', only links to the ONS's specific sites (i.e. http://data.gov.uk/dataset/2011_census_). From these sites, following the links to 'reference tables' actually leads to data. Also it takes some time to understand that a lot of statistics don't only include a snapshot of, for instance, the labour market in a specific month, but range back more than 20 year. So the most recent version also is a bulk data version. However, a yearly version cannot be found in this cases.","0","0"
