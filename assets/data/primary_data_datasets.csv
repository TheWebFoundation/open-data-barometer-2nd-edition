More precisely, the Ministry of Land and Resources recently announced that a nationwide property registry, as well as the platform for information management, will be operational before 2018 (1) and officially built the Department of Homeland Real Estate Registration Office on May 8, 2014 (2). The registration data was previously collected by various ministries and will be unified under the new registry (2). Previous registration data is also incomplete often. For example, property developers complained about incomplete information about land zoning, saying some local authorities had sold massive amounts of land without considering a possible oversupply of housing and commercial development (1).

The ministry is responsible for housing, including the real property data administration, urban development in both larger and smaller cities and of development in sparsely populated rural areas. The ministry is a part of the Danish ""Basic data program"". A part of this program is to coordinate between different registers that have used different definitions of the ownership term, based on the different needs of different registers/institutions. These different definitions will be consolidated into a general concept of real immovable property. The plan is to start distributing this coherent data through a new platform in 2015 where it will be free of use, with open licenses and available in bulk. See http://grunddata-ejendom-adresse.dk/delaftale1",,,"Currently, this data is partly available through two different servers, the OIS server and ESR (for public sector users or private users that need the data for public sector projects). Here is an example of how I can lookup my ownership of own house/land (as well as ownership of others)

In June 2013, the G8 nations published the Open Data Charter, which appears promising for Germany and France in terms of cadastre data. It is supposed to be published within two years (=2015), but until now no publicly noticeable action has taken place. For instance, a national action plan was supposed to be published until the end of 2013, which first happened on 2014-09-17. Also, no German version of the Charter existed until the end of 2013.

[1] http://www.skra.is on 2014-11-3",,,"Ownership of land is currently not available as open data. Clarification answer from Katrín Hólm Hauksdóttir, Data processing, Geo-Information Department, Registers Iceland [1]: 
Today the registration of land is arranged in such a way that the new number of the property is registered in the database of the National Registry of Iceland and the ownership is the same as the prior registered owner of the land. This file is a text file and it is possible to buy the data. 
Statistics Iceland also defines land properties in a spatial database. The ownership of land is not part of these data, but it is possible to connect the demarcation of land to the registration of ownership. You can buy this dataset from Statistics Iceland. In the near future it is possible that data on land assets/properties (i.e. excluding the registration of ownership ) will be made available on opingogn.is
It is also possible to connect access address data to the ownership of land in the same way, there is a list of landowners down on each access address.
The ownership of land is not a part of the open records, partly because of privacy but additionally because Registers Iceland depends on their income from selling data. If, therefore, the register of land assets will be made available on opingogn.is the ownership of the land will not be part of the data.

Saudi Arabia ,ODB.2013.D2.a,1,,"According to Al-Tamimi & Co. (the largest non-affiliated law firm in the Middle East), The Realty in Kind Registration Law, issued by Royal Decree No. 6 on 9/21423H, corresponding to 24/2/2004 (RKR Law) has introduced the compulsory registration of land ownership, in two step-process, the first being: ""The Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs will prepare cadastral maps of each property in a designated area. The Ministry of Justice will then document the rights relating to each identified property and that information will be placed in the register according to the status quo under the supervision of a competent local court judge.""

Given the amount of foreigners willing to buy land and build houses in KSA, changes have been introduced (or are planned, at least): ""The Economic Cities Act issued almost two months ago makes KAEC the first place where foreign nationals and companies are allowed to own property in the kingdom, the CEO said. Regulations putting the act into effect will probably be issued within a few months, he said. The new rules will also cover foreclosures, repossessions and the creation of a land registry."" (Arabian Business)

Thus, one may assume that the data is collected by the government (theoretically there has to be an ongoing collection) but that it is not shared.",,,"http://208.254.39.65/altamimi/e_article001313676.cfm

From these sites, following the links to 'reference tables' actually leads to data.

For contract opportunities it's Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps).",,,"According to a report by the Congressional Research Service, the Federal government uses a variety fo acquisition systems, including Acquisition Central, Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS), Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps), Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA) Portal, Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), FFATA Sub-Award Reporting System (FSRS), Interagency Contract Directory (ICD), Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), System for Award Management (SAM), USAspending.gov, and Wage Determinations On-line (WDOL). This is not exactly easy to cope with if one is mainly looking for some easily accessible datasets. In addition, the report states: ""Over the years, questions have been raised regarding the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the contract award data available from FPDS and its successor, FPDS-NG.""

The report features an overview of the acquisition systems on page 8 (2)
