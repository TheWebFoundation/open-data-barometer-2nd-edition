The quantity of datasets is still low and there are not many new datasets since the launch of the portal. Even though the Open Government National Action Plan states on its second section (first paragraph) the creation of this portal with a specific mention about the data there being open for its reuse.

There are more advanced open data initiatives on the local level with different levels of development. This is the case of: Bahía Blanca, Misiones and Buenos Aires.

Organizations and individuals have been demanding data and little by little they have been receiving some. The situation has been very different depending the initiative observed. In some cases these organizations have created their own data when there was any data available. This is the case in more ""sensitive"" matters such as government expenses, environment or politician's asset declarations.

Even though many organizations and individuals have been approaching to activities regarding open data such as hackathons, launch of open data portals, etc. In these cases the people aware of the issue is growing and they tend to collaborate with government in the creation from open data.

According to Leonhard Dobusch, researcher at the Free University of Berlin, the application ""Schau auf Linz"" (See I2) is used by a higher proportion of disadvantaged groups than other means (1).
The advocacy organisation Bizeps (2) worked together with developers in a barcamp to crowdsource information on broken public transport elevators in Vienna (3). After this necessity became apparent, the city of Vienna as owner of the public transport made the data available publicly. (4).

They expect to be perceived as more customer friendly and focused. External stakeholders (citizens, business representatives, science and research, journalists) confirm this positive perception. Also, the necessity and introduction of automated IT processes increases the efficiency (1,2). In an interview Peter Parycek noted that all administrations working with geodata observed improved efficiency through being able to provide data via a portal rather than doing so on demand. (3)

Presently, use of OGD is limited to startups and niche products (see I6), the researchers conclude (1). One more aspect that should be noted is the fact that companies might use the data internally and/or not submit their use of data to the data portals (Peter Parycek pointed to this).

"Bahrain","ODB.2013.C.INIT",4,"Bahrain has implemented a portal: ""The open Data Platform is an important initiative for the Kingdom of Bahrain as it aims to implement a public data hub and a strategy for open data to enable transparency and promote eParticipation. The primary objective of the Data Platform is to publish datasets from ministries and government agencies in a manipulative format, and making this data available to the public. Channels of eParticipation are enabled also to receive your constructive feedback on this platform along with your ideas on how the data can be used."" Most data it contains is out of date (stops at 2009) and in PDF.

In addition, the Bahraini Statistics department also has some hints about Open Data (see FAQ). The data is in Excel, Word or PDF and mostly outdated (stops at 2007 or 2009).

Legal status of these data is unclear: the Open Data Portal is labeled ""© Open Data Platform. All rights reserved by eGovernment Authority (eGA) - Kingdom of Bahrain."" while the Terms and Conditions indicate that one is able to: 
""a) copy, publish, distribute and transmit the Information;
b) adapt the Information;
c) exploit the Information commercially for example, by combining it with other Information, or by including it in your own product or application.""

Lastly, a website on Knoema labeled ""Open Data for Bahrain"" has visualisations and a pretty tortuous way of downloading the data. No license is mentioned here; the data is more recent (2013).

With this respect, I have chosen to grade this indicator with a 4. While some commitment exists, there is no clear congruence nor follow-up, let alone legal commitment to improve the situation.

The only competition launched by the Open Data Portal/e-gov officials in May 2013 has not seen any follow-up whatsoever. Additionally, the Bahrain Internet Society (involved in reaching out and engaging with civil society and fostering open data initiatives) has not shown any activity since end of August 2013.

Discussing ""Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence"", the report also highlights: ""Although the constitution prohibits such actions, the government violated these prohibitions. Human rights organizations reported that security forces entered homes without authorization and destroyed or confiscated personal property [...]. 

The government is required to obtain a court order before monitoring telephone calls, e-mail, and personal correspondence. Many local opposition groups believed the government monitored the activities of individuals and groups deemed to threaten national security. Many Shia citizens and human rights organizations believed there were extensive police informer networks.

Reports also indicated the government used computer programming to spy on political activists and members of the opposition inside and outside the country.""

A quick search on international privacy watchdog NGO, Privacy International, website reveals the amount of violations committed by the Bahraini government on its citizens digital rights, including pervasive surveillance of technology-related activities.

Although no privacy law exists, a number of laws and acts have aspects realted to this issue such as the Tellecommunication law (2002), e-Transaction law (2002), and the consumner protection guidelines (2011) (1).

""The Article 32 of the Constitution was amended in 1993 to include a right of access to documents held by the government.[1]  The 1994 April 11th law on publicity of information of the administration [2] states that everyone has the right to file requests for information to federal administrative authorities which must reply to the request in a timeframe of 30 days. Article 3 and article 12 establish that fees can be charged for copies. A decree [3] states that reasonable fees can be charged for copies [4].  Citizens can appeal the decision of administrations in the Commission for Access and reuse of administrative documents. [5] They can after appeal the decision to the Council of the State.

"Canada","ODB.2013.I.GOV",3,"Though the Canadian Government has made ""open data"" a key area of development in the hopes of increasing both efficiency and service delivery, the program seems to be too new to offer detailed case studies. There are, however, a few examples that offer a window into how efficiency/effectiveness might be enhanced via ""open data"": for example, a recent 'hackathon"" in Ottawa focused on using data to ""boost development effectiveness"" (1). While the government of Canada has also made funding commitments for open data initiatives, there has been little evidence that these have yet to contribute to either efficiency or effectiveness. There are, however, some attempts to evaluate open data/government initiatives at the provincial level, for example in British Columbia which has focused on making ""access to information"" requests more efficient/effective (2).

In particular, Canada's transparency and accountability with respect to development aid has been noted by international non-profits (3). Similar approaches have been applied to the provisioning of health care and health information (4). Despite these initiatives, the government has still been criticized for a general lack of transparency by not providing requested data sets (5). Third parties have begun to employ open data sets to increase transparency, for example to outline exactly how tax money is spent/allotted (6), or to make open data more ""user friendly"" and accessible (7).

The Canadian Council of the Academies has laid out a set of recommendations that partly build on access to open data in order to increase environmental sustainability (4), however it is still to early to assess to what extent they will be implemented, and thus effective.

"Chile","ODB.2013.C.INIT",7,"Since 2012, the Chilean government is part of the Open Government Partnership and has assumed certain commitments on openness related to data (1). That year, after public consultations on the matter (2), the Executive branch adopted technical norms on open data that applied to public services (3), which are required to make available data through the government's website on open data (4). This website includes also guidelines, FAQs, licensing explanations, and other relevant material for implementing open data by different public services. This initiative is led by the Unit for Modernization and E-Government of the Ministry General Secretariat of the Presidency.

In addition to the aforementioned ministerial initiative, there are other two leading government agencies working on open data. First, in the Legislative branch, the Library of the Congress has an extensive initiative dealing with legal open data, in which context they has released several data sets and models, as well as guidelines and related material (5). And, second, the Council for Transparency, an independent authority that supervises compliance with the law on public transparency, has incorporated open data as part of its commitment of transparency (6), as well as encourage other services to implement similar initiatives and citizens to take advantages from released data.

Although Chile has made significant progresses on government open data, there is still room for improvements. For instance, the former Executive implemented initiatives on the matter, however it did not adopt a legally mandatory rule on open data but a mere technical norm. As a result, open data commitments lack enforcement and lack continuity from one Executive to another. This may explain why accessible open data is still not comprehensive enough and lack uniformity on formats and timings, among other limitations.

There is also some evidence of government owned enterprises using open data for improving their services. For instances, the Santiago's metro system has developed an app that allows passengers to plan their trip in the metro system. Similarly, the capital city public transport system has an app for that purpose. Other apps developed by the government allows customers to localize oil stations and their prices for fuel, as well as pharmacies that are open to the public. Another application allows farmers to know in real time the prices of their products in the market, which empowered them for bargain sale prices  with distributors. Most of those applications are available in at the government's website for pubic apps (2).

The lack of entrepreneurship based on open data in the country may be explained because of open data has become an issue of primary concern for government starting only in mid 2012 and, therefore, it could be too early yet for developments by the business sector.

"Chile","ODB.2013.C.RTI",8,"Since 2005, the Constitution guarantees that acts and resolutions by the government, as well as their foundations and procedures, are public (1). In 2008, Law 20.285 on Access to Public Information set forth an extensive legal framework on public transparency, the right to access public information from the Executive branch, procedure, protection, and exceptions to publicity (2). The law created the Council for Transparency, an autonomous public body that promotes transparency within the public services, supervises compliance on transparency and publicity of information by the Executive branch of the government, and guarantees the right to access to information (3).

The law imposes obligations on public services in order to proactively concretize public transparency, even without a citizen’s request, by providing certain information online. Additionally, citizens could present FOIA requests, which must be answered within 20 working days (4). Generally, the responses are of acceptable quality and provided on digital format, if requester asked for it. In case of lack of answer or deficient answer, requestor may initiated legal actions before the Council for Transparency that adjudicates these cases within reasonable time (5).

The new law has booster public transparency and the Council has played a leading role enforcing the law. According to the 2013 International Transparency Report, Chile ranks 22nd among the countries with less corruption and most transparency (6). 

Although there was made significant progresses on public transparency in a short term, there are still some room for improvement. For instance, neither the law not the practice guarantee that information will be provided in an open or at least interoperable format, which reduce the opportunities of people for using the information in order to increase social accountability.

"China","ODB.2013.C.INIT",3,"There isn’t an open government data initiative led by the national government in China currently. However, as Rebecca Chao pointed out in her report on TechPresident, an open data moment is starting to take off and the government is playing a role in it (1). 

First of all, there is an official commitment from the government to release government information. China adopted its Open Government Information Regulations (OGI Regulations) on January 17, 2007, that came into effect on May 1, 2008. The Regulations stated that the General Office of the State Council shall be the national department in charge of open government information work, responsible for promoting, guiding, coordinating and supervising open government information work throughout the whole country, and that the general offices of the local governments at the county level and above shall be responsible for such matters within their respective administrative areas (2). On March 17, 2014, the General Office of the State Council issued the third set of annual priorities for OGI work by central government departments and provinces throughout the country, aiming to enhancing transparency of government’s exercise of administrative powers, the management and use of public funds, the distribution of public resources, the delivery of public services and public supervision information including pollution data, industrial accidents, food safety and credit information, and require year-end report to the General Office on how these priorities were implemented during 2014 (3). Government releasing government information including some data without citizen request is one of the two ways of implementing the OGI Regulations. 

Second, there is some open data initiative announced and resourced. Some datasets are made available online free of charge in both local and national level. According to the timeline of open data in China (government work) released by the Open Knowledge Foundation China Local Group, the first open government initiative was Shanghai’s Internal Data Directory that launched in September 2011 and listed 425 datasets by the end of 2012. The Beijing government launched Beijing’s government data portal in October 2012 listing 400 datasets to date, followed by Shanghai’s government data portal going online in December 2012 since when 206 datasets have been released. In September 2013, the National Statistic Bureau set up its data portal “National Data” offering statistic data and visualisations. Qindao City revealed its open data initiative roadmap in November 2013 (4). According to the About page of National Data, the site lists around 8,000,000 datasets including monthly, quarterly, and yearly data, as well as regional, national, and international data (5).  

The Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People’s Republic of China has built its own online data center publishing air quality data, surface water quality data and radiation environment data (6). The China National Environmental Monitoring Center (CNEMC) under the Ministry of Environmental Protection opened up the real-time data of surface water quality collected by the automatic monitoring stations located in 25 provinces and built an online system releasing the data in real time (7). 

In Open Data Index 2013 released by Open Knowledge Foundation, China’s national open data had a total score of 415 (highest 940, lowest 30). Among the 10 categories of datasets assessed, government spending data and election results data are missing. Among the released datasets, all are in digital form, publicly available, free of charge, online, and up-t0-date. However, none except for the national statistics data is machine readable. The majority cannot be downloaded as a whole dataset. And none of them is openly licensed (8).

"China","ODB.2013.C.CSOC",6,"There is some demand and engagement over open data from individuals and communities in China. For example, Urban Data Party is a knowledge sharing community on urban data and smart cities encouraging city planners to use open data to improve urban planning (1). QingYue IT Engineers for Environment is an NGO focusing on using data to protect environment through mapping (2). The Open Knowledge Foundation China Local Group is currently on ambassador stage, i.e., individual persons acting as ambassadors working to advocate open data in three regions in China (3). 

According to the open data timeline in China (community work) released by the Open Knowledge Foundation China Local Group, OKFN Local Group China was created on February 27, 2013, appointing two ambassadors: Biao XIe in Foshan, Guangdong, and Feng Gao in Shanghai. In August 2013, the first hackathon in China using open data for climate change was hold. Date from some Chinese government agencies and affiliated organisations, such as Chinese Academiy of Agricultural Sciences and the Guangdong Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, were used  in the event, suggesting to a certain extent the government’s willingness to support such type of hackathon and to encourage using their data. It was followed by the Hacks/Hackers Beijing Chapter event focusing on open data in September 2013, Open Data Meetup @ Chengdu and Open Data Day Hackathon @ Beijing in February 2014. On February 22, 2014 “Open Data China” network was launched. It aims to bring together individuals, organisations and companies who are interested in open data to advocate open data, cultivate data skills, support open innovation, and to help members partner with international organisations and projects such as codeforamerica, okfn, and open data institute (4). The Open Data China network has received interest from government officials such as the IT engineer working on the open data portal in Beijing, according to Feng Gao, the OKFN ambassador in Shanghai (5). 

The Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE), an NGO inaugurated in May 2006, uses government data to build national water pollution maps and air pollution maps, and establish online databases of enterprise air and water violations. One of the IPE’s mission is to facilitate government open environmental data and improve environmental transparency. The IPE has also partnered with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) to create a Pollution Information Transparency Index (PITI) to rank 113 municipal governments across China on their levels of environmental disclosure (6) (7).

"China","ODB.2013.I.ACCOUNT",1,"The Public Participation Research and Support centre of Peking University conducted several projects evaluating government transparency. Based on the China Administrative Transparency Annual Watch published by the centre, transparency scores overall increased since 2009 (1). The Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE), an NGO inaugurated in May 2006, creates a Pollution Information Transparency Index (PITI) to rank 113 municipal governments across China on their levels of environmental disclosure since 2009. Transparency scores overall increased each year, though with uneven progress across cities (2). These indicate that government have been disclosing more government information and data. However, Tan (2014) found that Chinese government’s Open Environment Information (OEI) measures failed to improve government transparency especially in the most polluted areas in China (3).  

There are indicators that civil society and individual citizens are using open data to make government more accountable. Some NGOs and individual citizens are checking the accurateness of government open data, particularly in the environmental sector (4). Data journalism has been attracting greater interest from media and citizens (4). However, Tan (2014) pointed out that the increasingly active civil society does not necessarily lead to effective accountability because of their little autonomy and weaknesses in the judiciary (3).

CNEMC claimed that there had been several cases where the open data played an important role in early warning and forecasting major water pollution accidents, solving inter-region disputes on water pollution accidents, supporting environmental assessment of major industrial projects, and ensuring the safety of public drinking water (1). 

However, there is disagreement from academia. Tan (2014) found that Chinese government’s Open Environment Information (OEI) measures were weak “because of China’s fragmented bureaucratic environment and the alignment of state-society relations under authoritarianism” (p.22) that they “failed to increase transparency in precisely the most polluted localities in China” (p.2) and that NGO initiatives, such as the Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs (IPE) using government data to build national water pollution and air pollution maps and establish online databases of enterprise air and water violations, “had an impact on environmental governance, albeit through unusual pathways such as the international supply chain” (p. 23) (2). 

In China, citizens’ raising environmental awareness, concerns, and campaigns are mostly not a result of government’s open environmental data but a driving force. On the one hand, environmental data was and is sometimes still hold by government as “State Secrecy”. Though government has opened up some environmental data such as air and surface water, useful data of drinking water quality and soil quality is still mostly missing. On the other hand, citizens are increasingly concerned about the impact of industrial pollution on their life quality and demanding their rights to know. NGOs, individual citizens, and sometimes enterprise have taken their own initiatives to obtain such data. For example, QingYue IT Engineers for Environment, together with the Southern Weekly, and Alibaba Group organised a campaign calling for citizens to test drinking water qualities of their hometowns. This bottom-up initiative for data gathering and publishing pressured government to release environmental data (3).

This is due to the fact that open data in China is still in its very early stage and implemented in a small scale. The only noticeable impact mentioned by government that has taken the initiative is that open data facilitates the collaboration between different government departments in terms of information sharing. The government of Hainan province established a Data Integration Planning Bureau (数据统筹局) in May 2014, setting the first example of exploring data governance in the country. It claimed that after a 3-month preliminary research, the bureau facilitates the connection of the previously isolated “information islands” through collecting, analysing, and applying the data that scattered over various departments, which could improve government efficiency and capacity (1). However, “information island” is still a prominent phenomenon in China, which leads to great waste of resources (2).

"China","ODB.2013.C.DPL",2,"According to an Report on data protection in China from Legal Solutions, Thomson Reuters, China currently does not have an overarching national level law on personal data protection. However, there is a national standard related to personal information, namely the Information Security Technology Guidelines for Personal Information within Public and Commercial Services Information Systems (Guideline) that became effective on 1 February 2013. But it is not mandatorily binding.  

In terms of scope of application, the Guidelines apply to all organisations and institutions who exercise public management responsibilities. But it excludes government bodies exercising any public administrative function that involves the use of an information system. 

In terms of the right of choice/consent, the consent of data subjects is required before processing personal data. Such consent may be implied or expressed. When collecting general personal information, implied consent is assumed as long as data subjects do not expressly raise any objections to the data collection or processing, whereas express consent must be retained when information collector collecting sensitive personal data (defined as personal information that would have a negative impact on an individual once it is leaked or modified) or when a third party processes the data on behalf of the data collector. Data collectors are required to give data subjects notifications before processing data. The notifications include the purpose of handling the personal information, the manners and means of personal information collection, the specific contents to be collected, and the time/duration of retention, the scope of use of the collected personal information, the measures for protecting personal information, the name, address, contact information and other relevant information of the personal information administrator, the risks that the data subjects may encounter after providing personal information, the consequences if the data subjects are not willing to provide personal information, and the channel for the data subjects to file a complaint. When personal data needs to be transmitted or entrusted to another organisation, data subjects must be expressly notified with information that includes but is not limited to the purpose for transmission or entrustment, specific contents and scope of use of the transmitted or entrusted personal information, name, address, and contact information of the receiver of the entrusted personal information. 
In terms of the right to access and correct, the data subjects have the right of access to personal data collected or the right to object to processing, and the right of the deletion of their data. 

As to the responsibilities of information holders, according to the Guidelines, the information administrator must adopt appropriate administrative measurers and technical means specifically adapted to the likelihood and severity of the damage resulting from compromised information, to protect the security of personal information, and to prevent the retrieval, disclosure, loss, damage and alter/tampering of personal information without the authorisation from the personal information administrator. But there is no requirement to notify data security breaches to data subjects or the national regulator. The sanctions for non-compliance with data protection laws include compensation for the losses resulting from the violation of the data protection, administrative fine, and criminal liability. But data subjects’ right of redress is not specifically stated and there is no oversight of the system undertaken by an independent body (1). 

According to a report on the Chinese Internet user personal information security status, 74.1% of the users reported to encounter information security incident (2), indicating a rather weak implementation of the Guidelines.

Suggest revising to 4 to reflect that the Guideline does contain many elements of good data protection regime, but that experience since it was passed in 2013 shows its application in practice to be limited.

Could also add justification:


According to 2013 evidence from the Director of Information Technology Research Institute of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, there are around 40 laws, 30 regulations, and over 200 policies related to personal data protection.

"China","ODB.2013.C.RTI",4,"China adopted its Open Government Information Regulations on January 17, 2007, that came into effect on May 1, 2008. The Regulations stated that the General Office of the State Council shall be the national department in charge of open government information work, responsible for promoting, guiding, coordinating and supervising open government information work throughout the whole country, and that the general offices of the local governments at the county level and above shall be responsible for such matters within their respective administrative areas (1). On March 17, 2014, the General Office of the State Council issued the third set of annual priorities for OGI work by central government departments and provinces throughout the country, aiming to enhancing transparency of government’s exercise of administrative powers, the management and use of public funds, the distribution of public resources, the delivery of public services and public supervision information including pollution data, industrial accidents, food safety and credit information, and require year-end report to the General Office on how these priorities were implemented during 2014. The OGI Priorities indicate that the government intends to release information of broad concern to the public quickly, comprehensively and accurately, and to release more information concerning specific administrative actions that government takes in tis daily work including information concerning the government approval and licensing process and about administrative penalty decisions (2). The OGI regulations set up two ways of accessing government information. First, government offices at local and central level are required to publish information of public concerns on official websites and community bulletin boards and in government journals. Second, government departments are required to response to a public request within 15 days (3). 

There is evidence that request from citizens are responded. According to a report from the Economist, over 70% of the roughly 3,000 requests filed to central government departments and 1.3m others to province-level offices led to the full or partial release of information (3). The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) on February 24, 2014 issued a report evaluating government agencies on publicising government information such as department reports and regulatory documents on their websites. It ranked the Ministry of Education number one in the index followed by the State Administration of Work Safety and the National Development and Reform commission, whereas ranking the Ministry of Foreign Affaires, the Ministry of Justice and the State Bureau for Letters and Calls at the bottom (4).

However, plenty of information remains off limits. Article Eight of the regulations says disclosure must not endanger state, public or economic security or social stability, an open-ended list that prompts utmost caution from compliers. State and commercial secrets are out-of-bounds (3). CASS also requested government information in written forms but found that many departments were reluctant to comply citing State secrets as a major excuse to withhold information (4). State and commercial secrets are vaguely defined. In February 2014, China’s government amended State Secrecy Laws stating that government departments must not label any information which by law ought to be public as a state secret, claiming to promote government transparency, The new order that came into effect on March 1, 2014 loosens the definition of state secret by making it more flexible. It has been criticised that the amendments do not change the specificity of what can be classified as a state secret (5). 

There is no dedicated agency to adjudicate cases or request for government information that are refused. However, citizens or organisations have brought governmental department who failed to respond to such requests to court. And there are cases of court rulings, although rare, ordering governmental department to release requested information. In 2012 courts ruled with the plaintiff in 18% of cases (3).

"Colombia","ODB.2013.C.INIT",6,"There is an increased government quest to take the Colombia to a better and more efficient data initiative. The Government has regulations, laws and websites dedicated to this particular topic. 

While the commitment of the Government and the Ministry of ICT is in the rising for open data issues; specifically in the design of public policy, regulation, and pedagogy guidelines; the very government data initiatives, as the State Catalog of Open Data and Economic Transparency Portal are left a little bit behind. Many of this cited documents are form 2011, when the Government sent its first commitment list for the OGP. However there has been little progress in the government open data initiatives and they are still very small. The data in the State Catalog of Open Data is far from complete and the data from the Economic Transparency Portal is not even machine-readable. In an follow-up report form the OGP for Colombia for 2012-2013 (cited below) it says that the commitments; mainly in public policy, regulation and pedagogy; are fulfilled but the open data initiatives itself keep on been poor. One of the reasons could be that the Ministry of ICT does not take open data initiatives as open government initiatives, but as e-government, making them part of its successful project Gobierno en Línea. I see a brighter future though.

"Colombia","ODB.2013.C.SUPIN",2,"There is an official Data initiative where the public can find, in a unified way, all data published by public bodies of Colombia, in an open format, so that they can be used by anyone to develop applications or value-added services, making analysis and research, work exercising control or for any commercial or noncommercial activity. This data, however, is national, so there is no sign of a full data initiative for any city, the public has to search in the national website for the available data. Some cities have annual reports, but a full data initiative is not yet implemented.

However, the two biggest cities in the country are taking short steps to build open data applications. Bogotá, the capital, has in its Development Plan 2012-1016 document some commitments for promoting the use of open/libre licenses and software, mainly in the institutions and public servants of the city government, but also in the citizens. Recently they put thousands of (incomplete and not machine-readable) datasets on a new and open official web for maps of the city. Medellín, the second largest and important city, was named the most innovative city in the world in 2013, and even though they have not made any official open data commitment they want to keep this title and they have expressed their interest in an open data initiative.

Indeed, Carolina Botero, a recognized journalist, wrote a column in El Espectador (cited below), the most important diary of Colombia, speaking about how abusive are the hackathons and other tech meetings and events and how the government used the technology professionals for its purposes. She and a moderate community of hackers and technology professionals end up proposing and inviting people to an alternative civil-society-only hackathon called Gobernatón (HackBo) based on ethics, that run the same weekend than the government’s (first weekend of June 2013), and was a total success.

According Karisma Foundation, a civil society organization that keeps track of the government's commitments to the OGP, the Colombian community of hackers has been unable to participate in several international events on open data by lack of access, organization and availability of databases in a usable format and with relevant and important information for solving the problems of society that are interesting for them. In one hand that is because of the poor quality and low quantity of data made public by the Government through its data initiatives. These data are generally not complete nor machine-readable. In the other hand events like hackathons and tech meetings that the government has made were poorly designed, because most seemed offers to buy very low cost innovative ideas and tools that technology professionals were generating for helping citizens to use open data.

Other strategies of the Observatory are to educate on the corruption issues and to generate public dialog and civil participation. Along all 2013 the Observatory published in open data formats (CSV and JSON) many datasets on the numbers and dates of the disciplinary, fiscal and criminal sanction of public servants in the country and in each department. The first publications generated much expectation and curiosity. The media was really interested in the data and many reports were made. However the Observatory website shut down because they won a grant form the European Union for restructuring it and adapt it to the new public policy of transparency. The website is currently in construction but in 12 months that was available had a moderate impact, al least in public opinion.

"Costa Rica","ODB.2013.C.CSOC",4,"There are no statistics on the usage of the data shared, or any follow up on how is society taking advantage of it. It is also needed more information to be shared in the Open Data website that could be used to measure financial performance, legislation compliment or volume of medical appointments in the different public hospitals, for example. The information shared is related basically to three areas: demographic statistics, national production for specific kind of products, and all the information related to Mer-Link, the electronic government system for the private companies to place their offers to become vendor for state or public institutions.

There are only three organizations from civil society mapped as stakeholders interested on been part of the project: Costa Rica Integra (International Transparency), Hivos (NGO contributing for a free, fair and sustainable world) and IPLEX (Free Speech and Journalism Institute, local). They are working on deploying different initiatives, such as conferences and workshops, communicating and getting to know the Open Data initiative, validating and consulting it with the civil society. However the civil society initiatives deployed to use open data have been really isolated, with a participation a a few tens and not coordinated as part of a planned strategy. Information technology professionals engaged with the initiative are really a few, and their engagement was more as a personal interest guided by their curiosity or interest than an intentional interest that would lead to a concrete initiative. So far, the engagement and use of open data in the country is very incipient. There is not yet any group using open data for specific projects or purposes, just isolated groups consulting it occasionally.

The CSO stakeholders involved are just beginning to define how will they join together to have a representation on the Open Government initiative. There is not yet any group using open data for specific projects or purposes, just isolated groups consulting it occasionally. The way how the government is engaging the civil society is by sending emails to the media, newspapers, news programs, the NGO’s mentioned and some private chambers every time something such a new initiative or a training session comes up. At this point, there is no demand over open data from individuals or communities.

Journalist in the country do not use the open data shared by the government on its websites as an information source for performance review or for public surveillance, since they consider the information shared so far is incomplete and not really useful.

According to Pablo Duncan, from Costa Rica Integra, the coordination campaign to work with the government on open data is just starting, and there is not yet a coordinated campaign aiming to create awareness or providing assistance on how to leverage on open data information available. So far the communications and training activities have been as follows:

-	Workshop open data for public institutions
-	High Level Conference on Open Government and Open Data: July-August 2013.
-	Disclosure of the Action Plan on Digital Government Agency Network
-	Disclosure of a bi-annual Digital Government
-	Open Government Workshop for presidential candidates

"Costa Rica","ODB.2013.C.INIT",6,"Costa Rica has a formal national open data plan included in the E-Government plan set by the government for four years (2010-2014), including dedicated staff (one person) and budget (budget tables attached). There is an explicit commitment to open data from a senior government, since the commitment with the Open Government Initiative was signed by the ex-president Laura Chinchilla in January 2012, during a tour to New York. The budget for the open data initiatives stands for the 5% of the total budget for the Digital Government initiatives.

On February 2013, the division in charge of the project, the Digital Government Secretary, presented the Costa Rican Alliance for an Open Government, the Costarican commitment and strategy to achieve and deploy an open data program in the country. It was presented to the Open Government Partnership, and it was approved by its board of directors. During the first months, the organization in charge to perform the strategy, Digital Government General Office, has made some progress on understanding how the initiative could be performed and what would it require from the different government entities.  The main deliverables were the creation of a national platform for open data (datosabiertos.gob.go.cr), the first open data contest called “Hackathon”, using open data from sectors such as agriculture, health and security, as well as some meetings with some civil society organizations. All these goals were met.

At this moment 20 institutions are taking part of the plan, meaning they are displaying some information in open data format, and who have published around 1.100 sets of information in open data format. However, there is a lack of useful information in those data sets, most of them are general information not easy to end in any action at the citizen level, since they are more like informational data. Some datasets haven’t been updated for the last months and no significant new information, from new sources or areas, have been included during 2014 to the national open data website. The government has prioritized other areas from its Digital Government strategy different than the open data plan during 2014.

"Costa Rica","ODB.2013.C.TRAIN",4,"There is some training publicly available in the country that increases skills on using open data. The Digital Government Secretary has provided in a join-venture with the company ""Grupo Inco"" to perform some talks, workshops, individual training and skills development of technology-based solutions (hackathones) since 2012. Its results have been two social applications using public data: ""Epicenter"" and ""Save More"", the first launched by the National Seismological Observatory  and the second by the Economy Ministry.

The University of Costa Rica has also organized conferences in this regards including experts in the field, however they have been isolated, mostly in order to start mapping the main stakeholders of the project from the civil society, and to discuss how the open data initiative should be performed by the government, from the CSO point of view. So far, there haven’t been any workshop focused in the used of open data in Costa Rica, that the parts and counterparts are aware of.

There is an initiative for the management of environmental statistics and indicators in Costa Rica, is done through a joint venture Committee between the Environment and Energy Ministry (MINAE) and the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INEC), formed expressly to consolidate a National environmental Information System (NARS), as a basis for determining the state of the environment and natural resources and the development of public policies that are required for protection. However, it haven´t been implemented yet.

According to NGO´s consulted, the open data in regards to environment is not enough to make it useful for planning or research. For this purposes, it is necessary to ask for further information than those shared (1 & 8).

Environmental NGO's, tourist industry companies and some institutions use to consult open data just to plan excursions, tours and outdoors activities. (2 & 3).

However, the different sectors have special concerns about personal data protection and privacy due to a figure created by the Criminal Code Reform Act 9048 to several articles and modification of Section VIII, called Computer Crime and Related, from the title VII of the Criminal Code, called the Superuser. The company accountable for the database have to finance and guarantee complete access to the information to the “superuser”, who “may at any time and as routine check that database without restriction, if there is complaint filed with the Agency, or it has evidence of mishandling of the database or information system. To this end, the Agency shall establish guidelines to ensure the proper performance or functional professional secrecy, and for all cases keep a log in which at least explains the reason, access and queries, as well as the officer assigned to the perform”. The law does not explain the reasons or in what cases can the “superuser” access the information, or what the guidelines are about how to manipulate the information in the database.

The law establishes the principle of informational self-determination which is in generally the right of each individual to decide what information provide, which is carried with it and General management and treatment of your data, stated in Article 4, 5. The law establishes the principle of quality of information, which establishes that the institutions, private and public, who handle information must meet certain characteristics, correctness and accuracy, seeking to ensure that persons information is correct, true and updated. Because of this, it is prompted to companies and institutions to have protocols and take the necessary actions, technical and organizational measures to ensure the safety of personal data and avoid its alteration, accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, or unauthorized access, noting the rule that ""such measures shall include at least the mechanisms physical and logical security best suited according to the current technological development, to ensure the protection of stored information"". If you do not meet these requirements, you may not register these databases with the Personal Data Protection Agency (Prodat), that was also created by this law, as the institution that will ensure the data of all citizens in the digital world Costa Rica.

"Costa Rica","ODB.2013.C.RTI",4,"In Costa Rica access to the information from offices of the Public Administration is a fundamental and constitutional right. Costa Rica has several laws and jurisdiction that provides a strong legal framework that guarantee access to public information. Communication media has successfully leveraged on this legal framework to demand public information when it have been denied. The citizens usually get responses to their information requests on a timely manner, at a reasonable cost and with acceptable quality. Most important public institutions use to have an information window and a press department to provide this service. However, there is not a law on access to public information, and this is the biggest problem for legal certainty in this regards.

There is not yet any approved Right to Information Act, but in the Open Government Action Plan 2013-2014 commitments were made to make advancements on the creation of a Public Information Access Law (5).

Most of the commitments were not implemented  (the adoption of an Act on Civil Servants, publishing 10 key OD datasets) 

Open Government Data has been mentioned in some strategic documents of the Czech government. One of them is the Government anti-corruption strategy for the years 2013-2014. In the document called “Digital Czech Republic 2.0 -  A way to the digital economy” mentions OGD, ensuring that published datasets are easily discovered by setting up the OGD catalogue which is one part of the OD strategy. 

One of the activities is a revision of the relevant Czech legislation which should strengthen openness of the government data and which should also reflect the requirements of the revised PSI Directive. Internal discussion within the Ministry of Interior about the revision of the FOI Act along with implementation of PSI directive is going on. The draft of revision of FOI Act with Open Data amendments have been prepared and is the inner resorts of Ministry of Interior. Extending the Portal of the public administration (portal.gov.cz) with the Open Government Data section and OGD cataloguing features is being discussed as well.

From this September Ministry of Interior (main guarantor for Open Government Data) is about to launch a OD project(http://www.mvcr.cz/clanek/otevrena-data.aspx, only in CZ) covering OD activities across all ministries, with founding OD catalog (data.gov.cz), OD trainings. More about this OD project in this PPT presentation (only in CZ).

Some Czech state institutions also publish its open data. For instance,  In 2013 Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic published subset of the State treasury data as OGD - http://monitor.statnipokladna.cz/en/2014/ Results of Inspection of State Authorities - http://vysledkykontrol.cz/. Czech Telecommunication Office publish its open data (http://www.ctu.cz/otevrena-data/katalog-otevrenych-dat-ctu.html) and also Czech Statistical Office publish data in open data format from census, election results (http://www.czso.cz/csu/redakce.nsf/i/otevrena_data or http://volby.cz/)"
"Czech Republic","ODB.2013.C.CSOC",8,"There is big demand for open data from the NGO's sector and from private sector. Otakar Motejl Fund (part of Open Society Prague) (motejl.cz/en) and  Opendata.cz - “Initiative for Transparent Data Infrastructure,”- OpenData.cz(http://opendata.cz/en). For instance, Otakar Motejl Fund coordinated campaign ""We want open data"" (http://bit.ly/1n6ua1e or in CZ ) to call for Open Government Data and OD principles. Secondly, Otakar Motejl Fund organized conference at Czech Parliament (http://bit.ly/1qYQbhJ) to advocate for Open data among MP's and state officials. Regular Open data meetups organized by Otakar Motejl Fund helps to connect Open data community with business sector. OGD community is also steered by NášStát.cz (http://www.nasstat.cz/en/ - OurState.cz) organised regular Open data meetups or hackathons (http://bit.ly/1zYMVZV).

Otakar  Motejl Fund, Faculty of Informatics and Statistics of the  University  of Economics, Prague and the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of the Charles University in Prague established the Open Data Forum (http://www.otevrenadata.cz/o-nas/) in 2013. Goal of the Open Data Forum is to foster adoption of the Open Data principles, especially  in the government domain, to coordinate activities of the OGD experts  and to collaborate on OGD related research.

Also Czech Data Journalism Handbook is now available in Czech - more http://bit.ly/1u97SRd. It was translated and edited by Michaela Rybičková from Otakar Motejl Fund. (see more http://bit.ly/1u97SRd )"

Also Vysočina Region have opened up its data (http://opendata.kr-vysocina.cz/). Since Otakar Motejl Fund prepared Open Data Handbook which aims to help cities and local municipalities publish its data, its is more likely that more regions and cities will follow up example of Vysočina region and City Děčín."

The responses are typically on of acceptable quality. However, sometimes, particularly in the field of open data, there is at least one case when institution did not provide requested information for reasonable cost, for data in open data format, it did cost almost 2000CZK.

Quite often requests from citizens are denied by institutions and when its requested again its denied for the second time, and thus it not come to the end. 

Nowadays the Ministry of Interior prepares implementation of PSI directive by the EU to novelisation of FOI which should be implemented according to PSI directive till July 2015.

This initiative is backed by 7 ministries, the municipalities and the regions.

Denmark supports the G8 Open Data Charter and the EU PSI-laws  and has recently joined the Open Government Partnership (2), (3), (7) 

The Danish Parliament has also opened data and the are some health data initiatives underway, but these are not coordinated with the Basic Data program (4)

According to this survey made by Deloitte, there are strong indicators that the open release of geodata has already had impact on the economy (2)
""The analysis indicates that the release – despite a minor effect in the market for the time being – has strongly pushed the innovation activities in the existing companies in the market and resulted in the formation of new companies and business units. This might sharpen competition in the market. Open geodata has gone from being an element that in itself was not driving innovation, but a cost factor, to become an actual factor that drives development of new products and services. Thus a basis for more growth and productivity is created though the effect has yet only materialised to a limited extent. 35 per cent of the companies indicate that they have enhanced existing products and services. 15 per cent have developed new products and introduced them to the market in 2013, and 15 per cent have developed products that are expected to be introduced to the market within a short period of time. Furthermore, 25 per cent indicate that they have changed or developed internal processes and working procedures because geodata can now become part of the business base, e.g. in all utility companies in the country. Finally, there are examples of new companies being established or existing companies establishing new business areas where the new market opportunities being a result of the release can be cultivated.""

According to a survey made by Geoforum (a NGO with a special interest for Geodata) the geographic data industry (about 1000 people today) expects to grow 16,5% in 2014 and 65,4% of the companies say that free geographic data has positively influenced their business, while 8,7% believe it has harmed their businesses (3)

Inclusion in the context of ICT and e-Government in Denmark focuses mostly on addressing the digital divide, and they have clear plans for that.

A new platform has been launched, where citizens can read about welfare initiatives and results of initiatives could impact the citizen’s knowledge on their rights (2)

A new app has been developed in Aarhus which provides citizens information about big events and disasters, such as fires or water pollution.

"Denmark","ODB.2013.C.DPL",8,"Privacy law in Denmark is supervised and enforced by the independent agency Datatilsynet (The Danish Data Protection Agency) based mainly upon the Act on Processing of Personal Data (1). 

In Danish privacy law, the two main acts that provide the basis for the collecting and storing private data are the Act on Processing of Personal Data and the Data Retention Executive Order.

The Act on Processing of Personal Data, Act No. 429 (the “DPA”) dated 31 May 2000 implementing the Data Protection Directive. The DPA has subsequently been amended by: Act No. 280, dated 25 April 2001; Act No. 552, dated 24 June 2005; Act No. 519, dated 6 June 2007; Act No. 188, dated 18 March 2009, Act No. 503, dated 12 June 2009; Act No. 422, dated 5 October 2011; Act No.1245 dated 18 December 2012 and Act No. 639, dated 12 June 2013 [2]
According to PPD Section 7 there may be no processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or data concerning health or sex life. Exceptions can be allowed under certain conditions. Private controllers must in most cases obtain the authorisation of the Danish Data Protection Agency before processing data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or data concerning health or sexual relations, criminal offences, serious social problems, or other purely private matters. An exemption from the Act is provided in Section 2, subsections 5 and 11, for processing performed on behalf of Folketinget (the Danish Parliament) and its related institutions, the Danish Security Intelligence Service and the Danish Defence Intelligence Service. According to Chapter 17 of the PPD, the Danish Court Administration supervises the processing of data carried out on behalf of Danish courts. According to Section 2, subsection 4, some of the rules in the Act do not apply to the processing of data that is performed on behalf of the courts, the police or the prosecution in the area of criminal law. The PPD and the Act on Public Administration were amended by Act No. 503 of 12 June 2009. From 1 July 2009 the PPD, Section 1(3), also regulates the manual transfer of personal data between public authorities. Before this date this processing operation was regulated by Act on Public Administration, Section 28(1-3). Transfer of confidential and non-confidential personal information between public authorities has been somewhat expanded (PPD Section 8(2) No. 3), since the amended PPD now allows for the transfer of sensitive information if it is necessary for case-handling for the receiving authority. (2)


Directive 2009/136/EC was implemented in the new Danish Act on Electronic Communications Services and Networks which came into force on 25 May 2011 in accordance with the implementation deadline in the Directive (3)

Denmark has decided to repeal the widely criticized session logging practices (5)

"Denmark","ODB.2013.C.RTI",7,"FOI law: Offentlighedslov nr. 606 af 12. juni 2013
People in Denmark can file a request for information either in writing, in person or by telephone – thus greatly facilitating the FOI process. However, there are no provisions for anonymity or protection from retaliation (1)

The Danish parliament approved controversial changes to its public information law May 4 2014, that will reduce the availability of documents prepared during the development of new policies and legislation. The law will exempt disclosure of correspondence between ministries and the civil service if a minister is requesting advice. Ministers’ calendars also are made exempt. Passage was ensured by the united support of the ruling parties. The bill was approved on a 99-42 vote, with 38 lawmakers absent or abstaining.  Critics argued that various past political scandals would not have been uncovered if the new law had been in effect. The expanded exemption, they say, is too broad. (2)

Sections 24 and 27 were at the heart of the debate. Section 24 says:

The right of access does not include internal documents and information exchanged at a time when there is a concrete reason to believe that a minister has or will have a need for civil service advice and assistance between:  1) A ministry department and its subordinate authorities. 2) Various ministries.

Section 27(2) excludes documents exchanged between ministers and members of parliament involving legislation (3).

11 thousand have liked a Facebook site ""saying no to the new FOI law"" (4)

Still, Denmark is number one on the Transparency International List of perceived corruption (meaning very low corruption) which gives an indication that there is sufficient transparency (5) and also scores high in voter turnout (an indication of trust in government) in the OECD better live index (6)

"Ecuador","ODB.2013.C.INIT",2,"The Ecuadorian government has made a commitment to comply with Ecuador’s Transparency Law (LOTAIP). As I have explained earlier, according to this law, all public entities must include on their websites all information considered public by this Law. The Law’s text includes a detailed list as to what is public information(1). Grupo Faro, an important NGO in Ecuador, measures the level of compliance of public institutions in the area of forest policy. According to their 2012 report, the governmen’t compliance with the law is better each year (2). On the other hand, the government has created specialized websites to offer open data. For example, the Higher Education Information System (3) (SNIESE). Given all these positive signs on the issue of open data, it must be noted that the website for the National Information System (4) (SNI) which publishes useful data for development and public finances planning is not an open data website. On the other hand, two regular users of open data published by the Ecuadorian government, one of them a consultant who has worked with many public institutions, indicate that information is frequently published in such manner that it makes it extremely difficult to use, that it is not complete or that is cleaned up or disguised previous to publication. Both informers prefer to remain anonymous.

Grupo Faro, which is one of the largest CSO’s in the country develops an interesting tool to monitor how the Transparency Law is being applied.

Additionally, there is a large public organization, the National Council of Citizen Participation which promotes the Transparency Law and encourages citizens to demand accountability (2,3).   

Nevertheless, the existence of a Transparency Law doesn't mean that citizens generally receive responses to requests for government information. Additionally, it is well known outside the borders of Ecuador that president Correa has had issues with the disclosure of some government information that have been strugling with the press on several topics. In new law, Ecuador extended the duty of confidentiality of information considered ""restricted circulation"" (Article 30).

"Egypt","ODB.2013.C.DPL",2,"Egypt does not have any personal data protection legislations in place. However, few other laws and regulations contain few provisions regulating the protection of personal data that sets out specific confidentiality obligations relating to employee information, information on money-laundering investigations, capital markets data and banking secrecy provisions.
Article 57 of the constitution of Egypt of 2014 provides a basic right to privacy by stipulating that ""the right to privacy may not be violated, shall be protected and may not be infringed upon. Postal, telegraphic and electronic correspondences, telephone calls, and other means of communication are inviolable, and their confidentiality is guaranteed. They may not be confiscated, revealed or monitored except by virtue of a reasoned judicial order, for a definite period, and only in the cases defined by Law. The State shall protect citizens' right to use all forms of public means of communications. Interrupting or disconnecting them, or depriving the citizens from using them, arbitrarily, is impermissible. This shall be regulated by Law"" (1). It has not defined data protection and referred to the legislative authority to regulate the communication of data in a manner that does not encroach upon the privacy of citizens, their rights and National Security (2).
Besides, ""the Egyptian Penal Code no. 58/1937 imposes criminal punishment for unlawful collection of images or recordings for individuals in private places. Some other laws provide for protection and confidentiality on certain data such as the Egyptian Labour Law no. 12/2003 (confidentiality of the employee’s file information including punishment and assessment) and the Egyptian Banking Law no. 88/2003 (confidentiality of client and account information). Egyptian Civil Status Law no. 143/1994 provides for the confidentiality of citizens’ civil status data. The Executive Regulations of Mortgage Finance Law no. 148/2001 issued by virtue of Cabinet Decree no. 1/2001 as amended by Prime Minister Decree no. 465/2005 has a similar clause which provides for the confidentiality of the data of the clients of mortgage finance companies. The Mentally Disordered Care Law no. 71/2009 has the same clause on confidentiality of the patient’s data"" (3, 4).

"Egypt","ODB.2013.C.RTI",2,"Egypt has no RTI/FOI law. In the newly adopted constitution of 2014, article 68 stipulates that ""Information, data, statistics and official documents are the property of the People and the disclosure thereof from their various sources is a right guaranteed by the State for all citizens. The State is committed to provide and make them available to citizens in a transparent manner. The Law shall regulate the rules for obtaining them and terms for their availability and confidentiality; the rules for their deposit and storage; and the rules for and filing complaints against the refusal to provide them. The Law shall also impose penalties for withholding information or deliberately providing wrong information. The State institutions shall deposit official documents with the National Library and Archives once they are no longer in use. The State institutions shall also protect, and secure such documents against loss or damage, as well as restoring and digitizing them using all modern means and instruments according to the Law."" (1)
During the last three years, taking into consideration the urgency of guaranteeing RTI for establishing the rule of law and fighting against corruption, many NGOs decided to draft a FOI bill to pave the way for the adoption of a new legal mechanism on the national level (1). The government joined their efforts but the end result of the drafting process was disappointing for the civil society and the unstable parliamentarian environment of the country for the last two years brought the process to a halt. Moreover, the draft RTI law developed by the government does not define clearly the national security reason to block information.
In addition, the national council of information, responsible of RTI law enforcement, is affiliated to the Cabinet and lacks its autonomy and independence. Its chairman is appointed by the president and its council is constituted of representatives from 14 government and semi-government organisations and institutions, including the National Security Council, Ministry of Defense, the Central Agency for Public Mobilisation and Statistics, the Supreme Council for Universities, IDSC, the National Archives, the National Council for Human Rights, the Journalists Syndicate, the General Union for Civil Society Associations, the Chamber of Commerce, and the four most represented political parties in the House of Representatives.
In fact, the government was usually putting obstacles and bureaucratic procedures on the flow of information to discourage professionals, researchers and journalists from obtaining them. Statistics were usually outdated, inconsistent or for a short term periods. Security permission is usually required for official documents and hard to be obtained leading to the inaccessibility of major data. Information related to military institutions is prohibited even for the economic, industrial and commercial activities of the army. Documents concerned with the high policies of the State could be blocked for up to 75 years, according to the law governing the Egyptian National Library and Archive (2).
Moreover, an assessment of information disclosure by four government bodies - Ministries of environmental affairs, housing, education and health - conducted by an Egyptian NGO revealed the lack of access to basic information for Egyptians (3).

"Estonia","ODB.2013.C.CSOC",7,"Open Data civil society efforts have been concentrated in Open Data Estonia Community. On December  1st 2010, a group of activists organized a round-table meeting in the Estonian Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications. In the meeting, clear goals and plans for action were set to introduce open data to the county’s developer network and also to get things moving state-wise. (1) 
In February 2011, one of the biggest hackathons in Europe — Garage48 (2) — was held in Tallinn with special focus on public services. At this event, the topic of open data was introduced to the general public. The message was carried on by many bloggers. (1)
Estonia Chapter of the Internet Society (3) has been directly involved in negotiations with Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications and Parliamentary commissions about open data. As a result of lobbying and campaigning, the law was passed in December 2012, that states that all future government databases with non-confidential data must be open to the public in machine-readable format for free. All such databases already in existence will be made free and open by 2015. (4)
Open Data law was voted the best law of the year. (5)
These initiatives have been in the past and recently there has been little activity on the topic. Even updates about open data on the web pages of Open Data Estonia Community and Estonia Chapter of the Internet Society are a couple of years old. This can be attributed to the fact that the law about open data (4) will take effect on January 1st 2015 and the community is waiting for it. 
According to „Independent Reporting Mechanism (IRM): Estonia Progress Report 2012-2013“ a Civil Society Roundtable (CSR), comprised of a group of civil society organisations, has lately served as the primary forum for consultation between civil society and the government.  The report rates civic society participation 8,82 points of 10.(6)

Tartu (second largest city) hosts Smart City Lab, the cluster of smart e- and m-city solutions designed to create an innovative environment in Tartu which boosts the competitive ability of companies by bringing together businesses, citizens, public authorities, R&D institutes and structures that support innovation. The cluster focuses on creation, development (including product development) and exporting of innovative e- and m-services taking in different spheres of urban life, being a joint project between the City of Tartu, ICT companies and infrastructure companies. It is conducting Open Data usability potential study (2) and has launched Tartu public transportation mobile application, which enables the users to browse timetables when offline and see real-time departures when online. Also, the application shows on map where the user is and where is the nearest bus stop. (3)

Tallinn has similar data and applications. (4)

All accounting data retrieved from local governments from 2008-2013 is made public. Everyone has unlimited access to view, download, compare and analyse data using the business intelligence software platform. This is, though, not an initiative of local governments. (5)

According to „Independent Reporting Mechanism (IRM): Estonia Progress Report 2012-2013“, the official open government action plan (6) lacks commitments related to local municipalities and that local municipalities are not involved in designing commitments in this action plan. (7)
However, Estonia's cities are relatively small, making it more difficult for them to maintain open data initiatives. It must be noted that the largest city, Tallinn, has a population of 431 000, Tartu 97 100 and all other cities have population of 60 000 or less. (8)

"Estonia","ODB.2013.I.GOV",3,"There are no reports, analysis, articles or other evidence to confirm measurable impact on increasing government efficiency and effectiveness. 
However, Estonian Open Data Green Book states that much of public information, including databases, are in digitized form and the Public Information Law gives local governments and the government the right to answer public information demands in open data form. In that case, the data holders procedural costs will be notably smaller. (1)

This could have some impact on increasing government efficiency and effectiveness.
Expert of the Ministry of Finance, Andrus Jõgi, claims that the impact has been very big considering the amount of data published. Before, says Jõgi, only Ministry of Finance and National Statistics Bureau used governmental open data, now the user base is much wider, including local governments. In addition, application makes it possible that data can be easily analysed in detail. Availability of data has made it possible for the state to use it in its decision-making processes, says the expert. (4)

About 40 000 people (3% of the inhabitants) participated in 2013. It is possible to map the garbage using mobile app and info about garbage is available and reusable.

The state initiative is peatus.ee portal (5), which helps people to easily plan trips and find, see and print out city- and county lines, several long-distance lines and timetables of different transport types, search optimal route etc.
Availability of public transportation data has helped to create several apps that help people with both intercity and longer trip planning, timetables, buying tickets etc, but these are available for free and do not contribute to revenue of their creators. (6)

"Estonia","ODB.2013.C.DPL",8,"Estonia´s legal and regulatory framework for protection of personal data is based on the 1995 EU directive on the protection of personal data as well as a number of ever-evolving and flexible guides provided by the Data Protection Inspectorate (1). NGO Internet Society Estonia Chapter is a member of the Data Protection Inspectorate advisory board and is fairly satisfied with the situation from the people´s perspective. (2)

The Data Protection Inspectorate, the aim of which is to efficiently ensure information rights, has shown itself to be a quite efficient and fast acting part of the government. In 2013, the Inspectorate reviewed 550 complaints, 1370 requests for explanation and answered 1344 helpline calls. Many of those connected to the right to correct one's personal data and the right to be forgotten. The use of monitoring and recording equipment was regulated comprehensively with guidelines. (3)

The only complaint worth mentioning is the slow handling of Data Retention Directive annulment and connected gray zone of use of data by LEA (whether the police and respective authorities can and for how long restrict data about people under surveillance after the end of criminal procedures) (4)

Very important is, that: 1) ""A request for information shall be complied with promptly, but not later than within 5 working days."" 2) ""If a holder of information needs to specify a request for information or if identification of the information is time-consuming, the holder of information may extend the term for compliance with the request for information for up to 15 working days."" (3)
 
There are laws, which mandate access to public and personal information, as well as laws, which grant the right to receive explanations and data analysis within 30 days. These laws are followed by the government in a fairly competent manner and oversight is provided by the Data Protection Inspectorate. 

Open Data laws are going into full effect on January 1st 2015. RTI laws in Estonia are fairly effective. For example, the Estonian Medical Marijuana Association sent a huge list of questions to the government and received back, within 30 days, a comprehensive and thorough analysis of law, statistics, practice, etc. regarding their areas of interest. (1)

There can sometimes be exceptions with politically sensitive questions when non-informative replies are given after 30-days deadline, but overall the can receive bogus replies at the end of the 30-day deadline, but overall this happens rarely. (2)

The program is going to result in national open data portal in which all open data can be found easily. One of the first projects during 2014 is going to be opening Government’s financial data.  
Open data is a part of government's public sector ICT strategy (2012) and execution of open government project and an important part of the government platform (new gov 2011). The program is based on the desicion-in-principal of the Finnish Government on opening public data and reusing it (2011). Furthermore, it is based on the Action Programme on eServices and eDemocracy (SADe) by The Ministry of Finance (2009). Ministry of Transport and Communication has a task force focusing on open data and open data is a part of ministry's project program called Kide.

Competitions Apps4finland and Open Helsinki Hack at Home invite IT specialists to develop innovative ways to use open data. 
However, this work has been going on for only a few years. Data has been opened and application development has been going on but there is still a lot of work ahead.  There are initiatives supported by municipalities like Helsinki Hack at Home and Helsinki Region Infoshare. They have help to develop innovative use for open data,http://www.hri.fi/fi/sovellukset/. These kinds of initiatives have spread to other cities to some extent.

While the overall feeling towards Open Data and Open Access has been (mostly) positive, part of the people active in the open data movement have expressed frustration to the slow pace of the changes. Most of the fault has been attributed to the slow bureaucratic approach of many government employees, where many seem to avoid potential personal risk related to larger changes. Even when government / public sector employee is clearly interested about Open Data, lack of support and resources from their peers can slow down the process.

Ministries, government agencies, municipalities, enterprises, NGO’s, various organizations developing the sector and citizen bodies are collaborating in the implementation of the programme. Government’s role is to make opening of data possible, give strategic guidance and take the first steps. The Law regulates how the government can give support; it can’t e.g. favor just one actor or company. 

There is some direct support for open data actors. For example Open Knowledge of Finland gets about 2/3 of its project funding from the government, e.g. for recent municipal road show and for public sector training days. 
 
Competition Apps4Finland gets some financing from the government, Finnish innovation fund Sitra and other national organizations like Statistics Finland.
Governmental Sitra is one of the financiers of Helsinki Region Infoshare.

It inspired Rovaniemi to start its own open data project and discussion forum in FB. Mikkeli published a 3D model of the city as open data. Oulu opened their open data portal in one week. Oulu has also opened the same kind of mobile Journey planner as Helsinki. Jyväskylä is going to open the decisions of the city in the same way as Helsinki.

Helsinki Region Infoshare has contributed strongly to open data in the metropolitan area. The next road show will take place in the autumn 2014. 

The work has just started outside Helsinki region and a lot of work is still ahead. According to a recent study by Association of Finnish Local and Regional Authorities 19 % of the municipalities has opened data and 20 % is planning to open data, 6 % of them had not yet opened data. 86 % of the big cities (+100 000) plan to open more data and 14% of the smallest towns (under 40 000) has similar plans at the moment. For some cities like Lahti fees collected from datasets are an important source of income and therefore there is reluctance towards opening data.

"Finland","ODB.2013.I.GOV",1,"The work for open data has just begun and there is little evidence of any direct impact. Open data is going to be a part of the guiding principles of governmental and municipal administration. Attitudes are changing gradually and open data is becoming a natural part of administration. It serves also administration because less time is needed to answer information requests of the public and journalists. There are no surveys yet but the government is going to evaluate impacts of open data in the autumn 2014. It is very difficult to say whether the development measured is caused by open data or other factors and to what extent.

"Finland","ODB.2013.I.ACCOUNT",5,"People are more aware of open data and can demand information and transparency from public actors. More and more public data is opened, e.g. tax administration opened corporation taxes in CSV form in 2011. 

Data journalism has spread and big media houses like YLE and HS and they are conducting DJ projects regularly. The data and the story is shared openly and people can use it to find new angles. HS has conducted many open data projects and published e.g. poll data, answers of the candidates and liabilities of doctors who give treatment recommendations (Käypä hoito -sidonnaisuudet). 

So there have been increased media visibility and public conversation because of various data journalism projects. In some of them, for example, political lobbying and funding of election campaigns has been analysed & visualised, and results have caused various amounts of confusion in the media.
Open Data usage is still quite limited, but things are slowly improving. 

There are some open data apps that visualize public spending (Veropuu), income differences, election results, follow MPs decision-making (www.kansanmuisti.fi) and decision-making (Helsinki’s Open Ahjo/Päätökset kartalla application).
 
In Helsinki citizens were able to protest against City’s decision to close a local school because they had access to open data, decision portal Open Ahjo. They used the same material as city’s decision-makers and noticed mistakes they had made in calculations and draw different kind of conclusions. 

It is possible that open data increases interactivity in decision-making and helps to involve citizens at earlier stage.

"Finland","ODB.2013.I.ENV",3,"There are very little environmental apps and a big part of environmental data is not open, like energy consumption. The data is often hard to interpret which makes development of apps difficult. Open data actors have arranged two environmental hachathons, the first in 2013 and the second 2014, in order to encourage development work. As a result new apps have been developed, e.g. apps that educate and help to recycle and save energy. The first Apps4Finland/Lounais-Suomi is going to focus on the Baltic Sea.

Authorities and citizens have started a web service in order to monitor lakes of Finland, www.jarviwiki.fi. It is partly based on open data.

The City of Espoo has made available a web service that helps to see where sun and geo energy is best available. Sun and geo energy maps are published as open data.
Finnish Environment Institute Syke has released open data, web service Oiva. They don’t have information about how their data is used. Also Meteorological Institute, National Land Survey, Forest Research Institute and Geological Survey have released open data which will probably be used by developers to a greater extent than now.

In the future there will be more apps and usage but at the moment the work is in its initial phase.

For example telephone directory company Fonecta can get mapping data for free now and mining companies can get land data for free. Google Maps was able to make a much better map of Finland when mapping data was opened. Google also uses open timetables of the City of Helsinki. A few apps have gained international success like Blind Square and Parkkinappi/ParkMan that locates you, shows you where you can park and collects your payment. Also an app called StormWind has become popular. It is a boating simulator that visualizes more than 30 000 square kilometers of Finnish archipelago with the help of open data. Many apps are not commercial and don’t earn revenue. There are expectations but results are yet to be seen.

There is some open data available within open democracy portals like Kansalaisaloite.fi, i.e. the amount of petitions. 
In the social and health sector many type of e-services have been developed within government’s SADe project, open interfaces is the norm but there is only a little open data utilized.

Marginalized groups don’t necessarily know how to use open data and how to find it. They don’t have skills to utilize it. Usually educated people are more aware of open data and can use it for their benefit, like when local citizens in Helsinki protested against City’s decision to close a local school. They could do it because they were informed and had access to open data, Helsinki’s decision portal Open Ahjo.
Web is used widely to provide services for many groups but open data is not yet widely used to increase inclusion of marginalized groups and to make government’s services more accessible for them.

According to the Act on the Openness of Government Activities public documents are public, secrecy is an exception (1§). Everybody has the right to receive a public document (3/9§) and the cost has to be reasonable (8/34§). The document must be given without delay within two weeks and in case it requires extra effort in one month (4/14§). If the request is refused the reason must be stated with complaint instructions (4/14§).

The Law in Finland is good and it is working rather well. It includes also internet and different formats of data. Delays can occur when the authority doesn't get requests often and is not familiar with the procedure. More schooling is needed for new and old employees, also for IT personnel. Sometimes authorities claim that their IT system doesn't allow them to give away the information. If giving the information requires substantial resources it is a valid reason not to give the information. At the same time the Law requires that IT systems are not an obstacle. 
It happens that the authority uses the 2 weeks law allows to provide the information and don't act immediately. Sometimes when applying the law authorities could be more flexible so that a court case could be avoided. Authorities use denials also for precaution. There is no sanction if you don’t give away information when you should but you can be punished if you give away secret information. It can also be a way to delay the process because legal proceedings take years.

"Germany","ODB.2013.C.INIT",6,"Responsibility for Open Data is not situated at the top level with the Chancellor, but within a very small department in the Ministry of the Interior, counting less than 5 people. The Federal states again vary strongly in their approaches, Berlin, Hamburg and Bremen still being the avant-garde, and others rather far behind, to the absence of any activities.

Open Data is not mandatory for all federal agencies, nor does such a plan yet exist. The Digital Openness Index illustrates this (1). Within the scope of Open Governement plans, OGD does play a role, but not a crucial one. The Federal government has announced to publish information in an open form in its coalition agreement (November 2013; 2)
The Federal Data Portal govdata.de is still in public beta, and also contains a number of non-open datasets (presently almost one third) (3). As long as we lack a central open data law, the quality and quantity of open data on the portal will remain low (4).

As Germany is part of the Open Data Charta, and thus wants to publish key datasets until 2015 (5), this indicates some movement also within areas where noting was bound to move. On the other hand, Germany didn't publish its short term agenda until the end of 2013, which actually was a prerequisite. This was explained with negotiations for building a new government after the federal elections in September 2013. Right now the agenda (!) is expected to be published by the end of the year. (6)

Grants are not available yet to my knowledge.

The city of Cologne ran a contest on Federal election data in fall 2013 (1)
The Federal States Berlin and Brandenburg ran a geodata competition called Geo|Apps (2)
The only known Federal example is the program ""Smart Data"" by the Federal Ministry of Economy. It wants to foster innovation through using data - it is not limited to open data. The first phase began in November 2013, phase 4 will start in mid August 2014 (3 + 4).
The eGovernment competition is actually done by three multi-national software companies (Bearing Point, Cisco, SAP; 5)

The Open Knowledge Foundation ran ""Coding da Vinci"" on open cultural data in summer 2014 (6)
The OKF and Young Rewired State also staged a youth competition called ""Jugend hackt"" (7)
Further the OKF organised two events spread out over Germany on the Federal election day (September 22, 2013) and the European Election (May 23, 2014) called ""Wahldatenhelfer"", a name derived from ""Wahlhelfer"" (election worker) and data (8)

"Germany","ODB.2013.I.ACCOUNT",5,"Detailed election data available in an open form allowed the Berlin daily newspaper Berliner Morgenpost to display the results on the level of all 1709 polling stations, adding demographic data such as average age, average income, percentage of welfare recipients etc. on this detailed level. This granular display allowed gaining very detailed insights for each voter. (1)
Another example is the budget visualisation site done by the Federal Ministry of Finances. It displays the budget in a visual form and allows downloading partial budgets in XLS format (2). This offering was inspired by the community-driven initiative offenerhaushalt.de, which already offered such a budget visualisation before (3).
The Pirate Party in Berlin and in North-Rhine Westphalia have launched two individual projects both increasing tranparency. In North Rhine-Westphalia, the made it possible for citizens and others to display community financial data on an interactive map (4). In Berlin, all (content) data on the capital region's scandalous airport project BER can be found in an open form and also retrieved via a content API (5). 
When looking at how data is made better available for citizens, ""Bürger baut Stadt"" (Citizen builds the City) can pose as an example. It displays planned building projects in Berlin in a comprehensible way (5).
Also an initiative of developers contributed to a better understandability of council information system data by realising ""Open Ruhr"" for several cities in North-Rhine Westphalia. It is based on openly usable data (6).

The site was developed as a masters project, developer Henning Hollburg sees potential in offering this service on a B2B basis.
Another example is the Berlin based company Lokaler, which provides interactive map and GIS services especially for publishers. It relies completely on open data (2).
The data journalism and visualisation agency OpenDataCity is leading in its field, with very high critical acclaim, strongly relying on open data and making data open (3).

Cartography) is relied on strongly since it was released as open data in April 2013. (1)
Other Federal states such as Bavaria (2) or Baden-Wuerttemberg also do so now (3). 
One measurable result is the acquisition of the open data based startup Skobbler (4) for 24 million dollars through Telenav.
A study for the German capital Berlin expects an economic benefit of publishing all of its data openly between 21 and 54 mio. Euro per year (5). This is more to be considered as a side note, as the study is looking into the future.

Thus, secondary funding via NGOs can be monitored and also analysed by the governments in the recipient countries (2).

The practice on the federal level is flawed by examples of overly leaning towards protecting security, business and privacy exemptions (2). In addition, the Federal Ministry of the Interior fileda takedown request to the FOI portal Fragdenstaat.de for publishing a whitepaper - ironically resorting to copyright reasons (3). The practical RTI has been further limited as the Federal Court of Auditors was exempt from the FOI right in March 2014 (4). 
Also, no consequences have followed the assessment of the Federal FOI law of 2012 yet (5)

My research strategy to answer this question was twofold. 
First, working on the project I examined the central government website (2) and what it offers – overall I can say that only the news section is fully updated, and the site is not easy to navigate. It seems that in order to have a centralized website, the government sacrificed the ministry’s independent websites, which are still up online “archived” – this just adds to the confusion. Material shared on the central government website is mainly on legal-regulatory  issues, administration, and there is no focus on data or a more accessible way of presenting government activities. 

Second, I also read online articles and statements by civil society organizations - in these criticism of the government for being non-transparent is quite common, but all that has a political and not so much an open data angle. 

Data collected through the Central Statistics Office must provide information for evidence-based policy making, but I could not establish a connection between open datasets shared by the government and how efficiently it operates. 

“Opendata.hu” is too small scale and scarce in data to have any real impact.

"Iceland","ODB.2013.C.INIT",5,"Central government and municipalities coordinated a policy on the Information Society 2013-2016, including an action plan with funding for open and transparent governance through 2016  (very low funding). This is what the policy says about openness and transparency:

""The general public, businesses and stakeholders shall have easy access to non-personal information and files kept by the State or municipalities. The basis for State and municipal policies shall be openly accessible data, providing a single portal for accessing such data or databases."" (1)

This policy resulted in a very small scale open data initiative at government level (Ministry of Finance), which concluded with a new open data license (a translation and adaption of the UK open data license) and a creation of a CKAN based portal with new (aggregated) data on government spending from the Icelandic Financial Management Authorities (FMA) (2). A new version of his portal will be opened shortly; the previous version did not work for continuous updates of data (3). The license used is not yet a government license but has been termed the FMA license. While the portal and the license were implemented by a group appointed by the Ministry of Finance, this is still not a cross-governmental initiative and individual institutions are working in silos. Many of them “depend on” income from selling data, and they also sell data to other public organizations (3). However, some PSBs had already opened their data through their own websites, like geographic data (http://www.lmi.is) and transportation data (http://www.straeto.is). While both of those parties have started using the FMA license but they have their own “version” of it so it is still not a universal license.

Basically, the choice was between publishing raw data on opingogn.is or extending the current ""Árbók"" which has more aggregated or ""cooked"" data. The group weighed in pros and cons of both - publishing raw data was considered cheaper and giving more detailed info, while the other option was better suited to inform people who might not have the required technical knowledge (1)  Option 2 was chosen and they are currently extending the arbok (they use the same table interface as Statistics Iceland) (2). 
Some think that the decision to publish more aggregated data instead of raw data might represent a distrust of openness, as those behind Arbokin have said that third parties that could take the raw data and use it might incorrectly interpret the data and draw the wrong conclusions (3)

I found one mention in Kópavogur town council meeting minutes where one attendant made a proposal for open data - there seems to have been no-follow up though.

The pirate party had Open government (collaboration and transparency) in their agenda in the recent local elections but they did not win big (4).  

In Hafnarfjörður, a new local government has stated that they will open their books, however this is not specifically connected to open data (5).

"Iceland","ODB.2013.C.DPL",9,"Personal privacy is protected by the constitution (1).

Iceland is a member of the European Economic Area (EEA) and therefore has adopted Directive 95/46/EC on privacy and protection of personal data and on public communication networks, and the Data Retention Directive (2006/24/EC) (2)

On 1 January 2001 a new Act on the Protection and Processing of Personal Data, No. 77/2000, entered into force. The act substitutes an Act Respecting Systematic Recording of Personal Data, passed in 1989. The act implements Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. The purpose of the Act, is to promote the practice of personal data being processed in conformity with the fundamental principles of data protection and the right to privacy. The Act applies to any automated processing of personal data and to manual processing of such data if it is, or is intended to become, a part of a file. (3)

Monitoring data controllers and ensuring that they take appropriate security measures, in accordance with law, is an important part of the DPA´s work on law-enforcement. Further information on the subject can be found here (4) 

The audits are conducted within the framework of rules no. 299/2001, on security of personal data, which incorporate, in a very simplified form, the methodology of the International Standard ISO/IEC 17799 ""Information Technology - Code of Practice for information security management"". (5)

However, Iceland has also implemented the data retention directive (6)
According to the data retention directive, member states will have to store citizens' telecommunications data for a minimum of 6 months and at most 24 months. In Iceland, obligatory data storage is according to the EU lower limit, i.e. 6 months, versus 24 months in some EU states (the directive says 6-24 months). It seems the data retention directive has problems regarding personal privacy and according to this Wikipedia article, in 2013 the Advocate General of the European Court of Justice opined that the Data Retention Directive is incompatible with Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights (7) and On 8 April 2014, the Court of Justice of the European Union declared the Data Retention Directive invalid  (joined Cases C-293/12 and C-594/12). The Court took the view that the Directive does not meet the principle of proportionality and should have provided more safeguards to protect the fundamental rights to respect for private life and to the protection of personal data. The Court also considered that data retention serves, under clear and precise conditions, a legitimate and general interest, namely the fight against serious crime and the protection of public security.

The law does not apply to the parliament, judicial system, Althingi's independent monitoring body (Ríkisendurskoðun) and private parties. 

Under Right to information clause, article 3 says: “Upon request, governmental authorities are required to grant the public access to available material on specific matters, subject to the restrictions stated in Art. 4-6. Nonetheless, governmental authorities are not required to prepare new documents or other material, exceeding what can be inferred from Art. 7.”
 The right of access to material shall apply to:
1.	 Any documents concerning the matter, including any copies of letters sent by a government authority, providing it may be assumed that they have been delivered to the recipient
2.	Any other material concerning the matter, such as drawings, plans, maps, pictures, microfilms and material saved on computers

Its stated intent is to increase transparency in the functioning of Government and also open avenues for many more innovative uses of Government Data to give different perspective (http://data.gov.in/about-us). 
http://ogpl.gov.in/
However, there is no corresponding effort from most of the state governments or local civic bodies for similar initiatives.

The data put up by land records commissioners in all the states is a case in point. Land records were the first comprehensive data that was digitized in India under a programme of the Government of India. The records are readily accessible through special kiosks or online by land owners themselves, or by others. But the data design doesn't have much value for those wishing to crunch it, or use it for innovative ideas.

It is about improving the life of people by proposing the design of an app that will find new and innovative ways to use NI open data. This will include data from the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA), NINIS, Spatial NI and/or data.gov.uk (1).

Requests involving electronic files are supposed to be treated equivalent to paper files, essentially blocking searches for data which a number of persons had requested in the past. From the viewpoint of open data activists this makes data and database requests impossible.

"Israel","ODB.2013.I.GOV",3,"Open data has had some impact on Israel, but little can be proved specifically in the area of government effectiveness. One MP Stav Shaffir battled for Open Data in the finance committee, resulting in the liberation of the data and use of it in order to stop changes in the budget, for the sake of efficiency (8). 
Recently the workshop for public knowledge (NGO) announced a new service they are working on to provide information about land zoning (1). Such service makes public inquiry much more efficient but it is done with very little government support  while activists must ""translate"" the data to an open format (2).
Another  example: the opening of public transportation data to the public in an open format (3) that is now used by multiple vendors to provide up to date information about public transportation. 
More example exist but the most ample one is an instance where the ministry of health paid a private company 120'000 nis to develop an app that lets women find  maternal clinics close to them. Activists from the NGO mentioned above managed to build an alternative app for free and were cited commenting that if the data was open they could have done the work in an hour. (5)
A successful project of open data is helping people finding their electioneering station (6)(7) that is built upon open data.

Though people in administrative positions are aware of the benefits of providing open data to increase government effectiveness, little is done so far in regards to data that can be used to amplify government services (4).  

Summery - There is impact on government services but it is mostly done with data that is not open.

"Israel","ODB.2013.C.RTI",5,"In Israel, the right-to-information law is active since 1998 (1)(2). The law was legislated because of a series of supreme-court rulings, and as an act of execution of recommendation of a committee that was appointed by the minister of justice at 1994. The law, however, is vague, has many exceptions for organisations not bound by it's provisions, noted from Ch 9 onwards in the law, and including Intelligence, defense and security bodies, and medical authorities (in some contexts). The minister of justice can add organizations and units to this list as needed and after consulting with the relevant minister and with the preemption of the Knesset's law and justice committee. The law also says that every authority who is subjected to the freedom of information law has to hold a freedom of information commissioner position. This commissioner is subjected to the authority, and serves it's best interest. Answers to requests have to be given in 30 days. The person in-charge of the unit may grant 30 more days, but they have to give you a written explanation to the delay. The head of the unit can prolong this period to a maximum of 120 days in total to get an answer (3)(4).

While the Freedom of Information act exists, and the government appointed a recent head of free information in the justice department, the default rule is to drag information requests to the courts or supply it after a long period of time and in a manner that makes using the data very hard (pdf, scans and faxes).

- The Agency for Digital Italy has issued the national guidelines for the enhancement of public information (2) and an ""open data agenda"" (3); 
- Italy endorsed the G8 Open Charter (4) and published its ""Open date action plan"" (5);
- Open data are one of the pillars of the reform of public administration that was announced securities by the government (6). 

However, the italian open data initiative is not yet resourced (7) and still lacks an effective coordination mechanism among all of the different institutional actors (government, agencies, etc.) (8) (9) (10) (11). 

In addition, it should be noted that there are no penalties for administrations which don't publish open data.

There is increased awareness of the importance of open data as tool to increase transparency and fight corruption, but it's not enough to support  decisions and  economic development (10).

- reports (like ""Report on implementation of first italian OGP action plan"" and ""open data census"") (4) (5)
-  projects  (like ""Confiscati Bene""  (6), ""Open Bilanci"" (7) and ""Monithon"" (8) ).

A campaign promoted by some NGOs, called ""OPEN SIOPE"", has been implemented by the government that published the informations on the spending of all italian administrations (9). In addition, the United States Agency for Digital has launched a public consultation on guidelines for the enhancement of public information (10).

However, there is no coordinated campaign for open data usage (11), and the government does not engage the community regularly (12).

- some of biggest Italian municipalities (like Rome, Turin, Milan, Florence, Venice, Bologna, Matera and Palermo).

Moreover, an important number of Regions passed (or is passing) open data laws (1).

However, there are a number of critical issues:

- Regions and municipalities that opened their data are a minority in the total (less than 40 of 8000 italian municiplities) (2);
- In several cases there Is not a strong open data initiative with significant resources behind it, including dedicated staff and budgets (3);

"Italy","ODB.2013.I.GOV",3,"The lack of a real national strategy in matter makes it difficult to observe a clear impact of open data on the efficiency in public administration (1).
At the moment neither Regions or Municipality neither Universities have realized studies or monitored this impact but it's possible to argue that open data have not increased the efficiency of government in a relevant way.

The lack of impact not depends by the low amount but by the type of published data. On dati.gov.it (national open data portal) there are very few data about offices and their activity. Moreover, there are a lot of Regions (especially in the South of Italy) which have not published datasets yet (2).

In this context, there are some good case studies where the publication of data have produced positive effects (3), like ""Open Coesione"" (4).

In the few months since launch, the importance of the project was reported in blog post (5), newspaper articles (6) and Open Coesione was nominated for Open Government Awards (7). The publication is part of a strategy that leads to more efficient spending and to compare between virtuous agencies and non-virtuous. 
The project has recorded some effects (8): which points out that - although the project has been started by only one year - can be recorded some effects:
a) in terms of impact on the quality of the data provided by different agencies (increased as a result of the work done by the project staff);
b) in terms of the activation of processes of Civic monitoring (www.monithon.it) and data journalism;
c) in terms of the context for the publication of open data from other organizations and projects (as PONREC http://www.ponrec.it/open-data).

Italy recently passed new transparency acts (Legislative Decree No. 33 of  2013) (2) where are prescribed measures for proactive disclosure on the websites of public agencies. But still few administrations have applied these laws (3).

"Italy","ODB.2013.C.DPL",8,"The Italian law applicable on privacy issues is the Legislative Decree no. 196 of 30 June 2003 (""Codice in materia di protezione dei dati personali"", the ""Privacy Code"") (1). The Privacy Code implements Directives 46/1995/EC and 58/2002/EC.

The Italian Data Protection Authority plays an active role in enforcing the regulation, and investigating emerging issues raised by new technologies (4). 

The Code applies to any personal data processing activity performed by any entity established either (Article 5, Code):

- In Italian territory.
- In a place under Italian sovereignty
- in both the public and private sectors.
- Outside the EU, where an entity makes use of equipment, whether automated or non-automated, situated in Italian territory, unless equipment is only used for purposes of transit through the territory.

The Code also applies to any processing performed by natural persons for exclusive personal purposes if the data are intended for systematic communication or dissemination. The provisions concerning civil liability and security measures apply in any case.

The Code provides a national Data Protection Authority (DPA) called ""Garante"".

Following a recent amendment to the Code, the concept of personal data has been limited to information relating to natural persons, identified or identifiable, even indirectly, by reference to any other information including a personal identification number (Article 4 b), Code). Sub-categories of personal data include sensitive data, judicial data, and traffic and location data.

As a general obligation, personal data must be:

- Processed lawfully and fairly.
- Collected and recorded for specific, explicit and legitimate purposes and used in further processing operations consistent with these purposes.
- Accurate and, when necessary, kept updated.
- Relevant, complete and adequate in relation to the purposes for which they are collected or subsequently processed.
- Kept in a form which permits identification of the data subject for a period of no longer than the necessary for the purposes for which the data were collected or subsequently processed.

The main obligations imposed on data controllers are to:

- Provide the data subjects with prior information on the processing of their personal data.
- Obtain, if necessary, the data subject's consent.
- Implement technical or organisational security measures.

Processing of personal data by private entities or by profit-seeking public bodies is allowed only if the data subject has provided a valid prior consent. To be considered as valid, consent must be:

- Based on proper prior information.
- Express.
- Freely given.
- Specific with regard to a clearly identified processing.
- Documented in writing.
- In writing if the processing concerns sensitive data.

Specific rules may apply to processing carried out by public authorities.

Some basic information must be provided to the data subject at the time of collection or, in case of collection through third parties, no later than at the moment of recording of data or of their first communication (Article 13, Code). This information includes:

- The purposes and methods of the processing.
- The mandatory or voluntary nature of providing the requested data.
- Consequences of the failure to reply.
- The entities or categories of entity to whom the data can be communicated, or who may get to know the data in their capacity as data processors or persons in charge of the processing, and the scope of dissemination of the data.
- Rights granted under Article 7 of the Code.
- Some identification data concerning the data controller and, where appointed, the data controller's representative in Italian territory under Article 5 of the Code, as well as the data processor.

Data subject is entitled to obtain confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him exists, regardless of this already being recorded, and the communication of the data in an intelligible form (Article 7, Code). A data subject also has the right to be informed of:

- The source of the personal data.
- The purposes and methods of the processing.
- The logic applied to the processing, if the latter is carried out through electronic means.
- Identification data of the data controller, data processors and any representative designated by the data controller established outside the EU making use of equipment, whether electronic or otherwise, situated in Italian territory.
- The entities or categories of entity to whom personal data can be communicated and who can get to know this data in their capacity as a designated representative in Italian territory, data processor or person in charge of the processing.

A data subject has the right to obtain:

- Updating, rectification or integration of data.
- Erasure, anonymization or blocking of data that have been unlawfully processed, including data whose retention is unnecessary for the purposes for which they have been collected or subsequently processed.
- Certification that the actions listed above have been carried out.

A data subject has the right to object, in whole or in part to:

- The processing, on legitimate grounds, of his personal data, even though they are relevant to the purpose of the collection.
- The processing of his personal data, when carried to send advertising materials, for direct selling or to perform market or commercial communication surveys.

Data subjects can settle disputes either through the courts or by lodging a complaint with the DPA in case they have been prevented from exercising access/erasure/rectification/updating rights (as per Section 7 of the code).

The effectiveness of the rights described above is guaranteed (3) by the judicial system as well as the important activities (4) of the DPA. 
These are its powers: 

- Supervising compliance with the provisions protecting private life; 
- Handling claims, reports and complaints Lodged by citizens; 
- That banning or blocking processing operations are Liable to cause serious harm to individuals; 
- Checking, Also on citizens' Behalf, into the processing operations performed by police and intelligence services; 
- Carrying out on-the-spot inspections Also access to databases Directly; 
- Reporting to judicial Authorities on serious Infringements; 
- Raising public awareness of privacy legislation; 
- Fostering the adoption of codes of practice for various industry sectors.

While a regulatory data protection framework does exist, in practice such law is unable to actually protect citizens' privacy, neither during court trials, nor when it comes to tax/fiscal issues, nor on the Web. Also, while the law does give the chance for individuals to choose to give or deny their consent to use their private information, some companies can use the trick of putting individuals in the situation that in case they don't give their consent, they (the companies) won't provide the services.

"Italy","ODB.2013.C.RTI",4,"Italy passed a Legislative Decree (no 33 of 2013) and has taken important steps over the last year to improve its transparency standards (1).
However, Italy still lacks a proper Freedom of Information Act, and its legal framework on access to information is considered by international experts and organizations to be among the most restrictive in Europe. 

The Constitution of Italy is silent on the matter of access to information. Law no 241 of 1990, The Administrative Procedure Act (2),  remains the cornerstone of the current regulations of access, according to which:

1. right of access shall mean the right of interested parties to inspect and take copies of administrative documents;
2. interested parties shall mean all private parties (including those having interests that are public or diffuse) who have a direct, concrete and currently existing interest, corresponding to a legally protected situation that is linked to the document to which access is requested;
3. requests of access made with the aim of generally monitoring the work of public authorities shall not be admissible;
4. public bodies must respond to requests within 30 days, but can withhold information related to security, national defense and international relations, public order and monetary and foreign exchange policy.

Since 2009, a series of different regulations (Legislative Decree no 150 of 2009, Decree no 83 of 2012 and Legislative Decree no 33/2013) have introduced in the Italian legal system principles such as the full disclosure of all information regarding the activities of public institutions and the total accessibility, also by electronic means, of all public data and information.

These new regulations have added several proactive elements of disclosure with the potential to improve the overall transparency and facilitate access to information. However, no measures on proactive disclosure have been introduced, as law 241/90 has remained untouched. 

Moreover, recent work from Agorà Digitale, an organization working on transparency and digital rights, has shown that Italian Administrations often do not abide even the proactive disclosure regulations, effective since January 2013 (3). 

Therefore, Italy is still lacking a proper Freedom of Information Act (4). This circumstance is also demonstrated by the fact that Italy is one of the ""bottom 10 countries"" in RTI Rating (5) .

It's important to note that there is an important report on the implementation of RTI Law in Italy from NGO ""Diritto di Sapere"" (6). The report presents the results of the first ever conducted monitoring study testing access to government held information in Italy. Thirtythree representatives of civil society organizations, journalists and other members of the public participated in the testing exercise by submitting 300 requests of information to public authorities across nine thematic areas, namely: environment, human rights, justice, public spending, education, social services, government performances, financial investments and health.

A key finding is that less than one quarter of the requests resulted in information being provided to the requester. Only 27% of requests led to fully satisfactory information being provided whereas 73% of all responses was not compliant with right to information international standards. The level of administrative silence (complete lack of response from the public authorities after 30 calendar days) was extremely high, representing 65% of all requests.

Disputes relating to the application of the RTI Law fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the administrative courts. So citizens are obliged to bring their legal claims to court with expensive costs and complicated legal procedures (7).

"Jamaica","ODB.2013.C.INIT",3,"An off-the-record interview (1) indicated that Jamaica is not overly involved in the Open Data initiative, as far as government efforts go.

There is just a funded open government data initiative led by the Mona School of Business & Management @ University of the West Indies, a founding member of the Caribbean Open Institute (2), which was established to facilitate open data initiatives in the Caribbean region. While not government-led, the initiative has garnered active support from the Ministry of Science & Technology, and is reflected in the Government of Jamaica's (GOJ) ICT Roadmap (see pp.47 of the Junior Minister's 2014 sectoral debate (3, pp47). The GOJ has also indicated it's intent to partner with the World Bank to undertake an Open Data Readiness Assessment for Jamaica in the 4th quarter, 2014 and to work towards establishing an Open Data Policy and official Open Government Data Portal by December 2014.

While not led by the GOJ, the initiative has realized Government collaboration at several Ministry/Agency levels: - Agriculture: Partnership with RADA to explore the use of open data to to enhance the delivery of extension services and support the fight against praedial Larceny"" (4). This 6-month partnership[ produced a prototype Agriculture API (5). See also feature blog piece on Code-for-America site. (6) Other initiatives have been undertaken in Tourism & Education. Several Open Data resources from these sectors are available online 

There is, however, a relatively responsive office devoted to Access to Information, as well as active Access to Information legislation. The only open data initiative readily available is the Edward Seaga database. (7) (8)

The government appears to be promoting only basic best practices (such as proper storage of paper records) let alone the release of open data on ICTs. (1) (2) Civil society groups are concerned that a lack of data, let alone open data, is leading to policy creation and implementation that is based on incomplete information.

The Open Data initiatives that have been enacted thus far, have all been largely demand-side initiatives led by CSOs (eg. Caribbean Open Institute), and information technology professionals (Slashroots Foundation) engaging with the government agencies. The Code-for-the-Caribbean initiative that was used as the model of engagement with RADA, mentioned in C1, reflects this collaboration. (3)  Other CSO-led initiatives include the Edward Seaga Database Collection, which is is a compilation macroeconomic variables and national statistics collected from government agencies, including the Statistical Institute of Jamaica, the Bank of Jamaica, the Planning Institute, the Ministries of Finance and Education, covering the period: 1950 to 2010. The Caribbean Open Institute has conducted a coordinated program of awareness, advocacy and engagement with government agencies for open data usage, over the past 2 years through various research and event initiatives.

The Norton Rose Fullbright report on global policy states that ""Japan has a sophisticated and unique privacy regime..a series of data privacy guidelines published by different Ministries in Japan which, although they do not technically have the force of law, are generally complied with by data  users.""

"Japan","ODB.2013.C.RTI",7,"Japan’s national information disclosure law took effect in 2001(1). It requires administrative branches to open information to the public as well as protecting the right to information of the citizens. 
One special feature of Japan’s system pioneered by local governments is the role played by “Information Disclosure and Personal Information Protection Review Boards” to hear administrative appeals.  The Review Boards, comprised of retired officials, lawyers, academics and other prominent members of the community, provide dissatisfied requesters with an alternative to litigation. Review Board appeals are popular because there are no fees and because the Boards have a duty to conduct their own investigations, including review of documents and other information at issue (2). 

The RTI Ranking analysis notes Japan's legal RTI regime is weak on sanctions for non-compliance[3], although Freedom Info[1] suggest the majority of requests are fulfilled. 
It should be noted that Japan passes a secrecy law in December 2013, where critics say it will curtail public access to information on a wide range of issues. (4)

"Jordan","ODB.2013.C.INIT",4,"Jordan joined the OGP in 2011. For the purpose of participating in the OGP, the Prime Minister formed an Ad-hoc Committee in October 2011 comprising representatives from the public and private sectors in addition to civil society organizations to work on developing Jordan’s national Action Plan pertaining to the participation in this Partnership. The OGP national Action Plan of Jordan, which is published on the Jordanian Prime Ministry’s website (www.pm.gov.jo), both in Arabic and English languages, constitutes an integral part of our national reform plans, and focuses on addressing three grand challenges:  

1) Improving public services

2) Increasing public integrity

3) More effectively managing public resources

The Ad-hoc Committee is currently developing Jordan’s second national Action Plan focusing on the work of “the Royal Committee for enhancing the National Integrity System” headed by the Prime Minister. This Royal Committee is currently engaged in a wide and inclusive consultation process across the Kingdom to build a national consensus around a National Charter for strengthening the integrity system in the country, which will serve as a road map for future reforms in this vital area towards strengthening integrity, transparency, the rule of law, accountability, justice and equal opportunities.   

Though Jordan seems to have delivered on its commitments and submitted/working on their action plan, at the time of conducting this research, it was difficult to fully assess this commitment and progress. Also, there seems to be some efforts by the government to release government data online to the public through its e-portal [3], with a special section on ""Open Data"" that contains almost 60 datasets[4]. Examples of the datasets include: agricultural price indices, areas by region and governorates, central government domestic revenues, construction,
consumer price index consumer price index, electricity consumption, estimated
population, indicators of national accounts, indicators of social security,
ministry of health statistics, mortality data, crimes statistics, museums and
archaeological sites, employment distribution, communications and information
indicators, health indicators, selected indicators, syndicates, tourism,
transport and communications indicators, central government budget, topography.
Difficult to find information/url to support an assessment of the ""well
resourced"" part of the question. 
Other efforts include the Economic Research Forum (ERF) initiative through its partnership with statistical offices around the Arab region making micro data accessible to the public by collecting, harmonizing and documenting the data. Building on these efforts,
ERF has recently launched the Open Access Micro Data Initiative (OAMDI) that
consists of dissemination micro data [5]. This initiative has already started to bear its fruits as 27 datasets from three Arab countries namely Egypt,
Palestine and Jordan are now accessible via the new ERF data portal [6]. There is also this website that provides different kinds of data. It was a bit difficult to use, however.

"Jordan","ODB.2013.C.CSOC",3,"Many journalists, parliamentarians and other citizen groups often ask for information regarding alleged corrupt practices and abuse of public
funds/position, as well as other areas, but no information is given. There is, therefore, some engagement from the demand side, but not the supply side. There is plenty of data available (e.g. budgets, names and contacts for various departments, map data, etc.), but any information deemed to be
""detrimental to the reputation of the state"", or deemed to be security-related, is not released, and people who publish negative information
could be arrested for doing that.  A ujuzi data bootcamp was held in Jordan in April 2013. The camp is designed to give journalists, civic activists, and coders a crash-course in the most important techniques and tools needed to harness open data. The bootcamps were
pioneered by the African Media Initiative (AMI) and the World Bank Institute (WBI). Though there wasn’t clear engagement from the government in this camp,
it was co-chaired by two high profile Jordanian media experts including HHR PRINCESS RYM ALI [1]

There is also an indication of a local chapter of Hacks-Hackers in Jordan. There are few activities and announcements for Hackathouns in Amman but no articles/reports on contributions or solutions.

"Jordan","ODB.2013.C.RTI",2,"Articles 15 and 17 of the Jordanian constitution are a major citation source for the legal establishment of the foundation of the individuals’ right to access
information. In May 2007, the Law on Guarantee of Access to Information‖ No. 47 (2007) was promulgated [1]. Article 7 of the Law statesthat, “Every Jordanian has to right to obtain the information he/she requires
in accordance with the provisions of this Law, if he/she has a lawful interest or
a legitimate reason therefor. Article 8 obligates officials to facilitate
access to information and guarantee the disclosure thereof without delay and in
the manner stipulated in the present law”.

However, in a report published by the National Center for Human Rights [2], the center notes that despite the bright picture of the Law on Guarantee of Access to Information, ”reference should be made to the legal or practical challenges andproblems that have accompanied the implementation of this law.  The Center concludes that the challenges and exceptions vary greatly to the point that it becomes very difficult to activate the citizen’s right to obtain information. Other assessments concluded that in practice, no information is given and there is widespread repression of freedoms of speech and the press [3] and [4].

The Jordanian RTI law was modified in 2013. There are no reports on how it implemented except criticism from the press and from expert that I have personally interviewed pointing out two elements: the traditional culture of secrecy surrounding the work of government agencies and all information concerning it and the lack of public will to break that secrecy.

This is because the country is facing challenges when it comes to proactively providing information through the portal. Therefore, it is difficult the measure the impact levels of the open data portal which was launched in Kenya in July 2011. However, there is one example: the publication of public finance audited accounts 2010/11 in the portal did raise important debate both outside and inside parliament and increased transparency and questioning of government actions. There has been some increased transparency and some accountability for example after the publication of county expenditures, Governors have been called by the Senate Committee to account for such expenditures especially in counties where there were serious anomalies.

A news article published in the Daily Nation says there is lack of data in Kenya which hampers planning. The article quotes Prof Mwangi Kimenyi, a senior fellow with Brookings Institution who says he encountered challenges when trying to access data which form the background of making decisions. It also quotes Jason Lakin of International Budget Partnerships who has always questioned failure by Treasury and the Commission of Revenue Allocation (CRA)to make public the data that has formed the basis for a lot of decision making touching on devolution.

Kenya News Agency (KNA)also quoted Lakin, the IBP Programme Officer urging government ministries to improve transparency in National Budget Implementation. Also quoted in the article is the Kenya Aids NGO’s Consortium (KANCO) Policy and advocacy Manager,  Margaret  Kabue who challenged treasury to make budget proposal more transparent by expanding public engagement and parliamentary oversight. The two spoke during the National Budget presentation towards improved transparency in Kenya for year 2014/2015 in Nairobi. (3)

Article 19, an international organization with a bias on freedom of information and expression says there has been limited progress on enabling access to information and transparency regimes. The organization has presented an individual submission to the universal periodic review on Kenya for consideration at the 21st session of the UN working group in January-February 2015. In the write-up, it points out that the Kenyan government committed to the Open Government Partnership-a global multilateral initiative to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption and harness new technologies to strengthen governance. As much as the portal has been lauded as the most significant steps Kenya has made to improve governance and implement Kenya's constitutional guarantee of access to information, the portal is not frequently updated due to poor coordination and unwillingness by most state departments to proactively provide information. In addition, the government has not reported on the status of the implementation of the country action plan through which it made commitment to enact Access to Information Bill 2013 and Data Protection Bill 2013. (4)

Even so, some organizations like Ushahidi a non profit organization have also used open data to track elections in order to ensure transparency (5).

"Kenya","ODB.2013.I.ENV",0,"We find that the Kenyan government has in place the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) whose role is to implement all policies relating to environment. In its website, it has two crucial documents; Environmental Audit and Environment Impact Assessment (EIA). The document on Environmental Audit provides periodic and objective evaluation of how far activities and processes of on-going projects conform with approved environment management plan of that specific project as well as sound environment practices. Through this document, different organizations are able to know how the environmental auditor appraises projects to ensure they comply with environmental regulatory frameworks, standards, health and safety measures and sustainable use of natural resources. On the other hand, EIA ensures that the decisions on proposed projects and activities are environmentally sustainable. (1)

However, as much as these documents are available, there is still a major challenge as far as impact of open data on environmental sustainability is concerned. There is no noticeable impact. An article published in America's Internews website is a clear testimony of what is happening on the ground as far as this issue is concerned. The article states that although Kenya has identified new natural resources, its biggest find yet, data about those resources are not available. The author of the article claims he spoke with a Senior Turkana county government official who allegedly told him the Governor's office has access to geo-located oil drilling data but the information is confidential and restricted to a small circle. The writer further refers to the official agreement between Ministry of Energy and a foreign oil company. According to Land Quest team, they have in their possession a document on commitment to continued secrecy. (2)

"Kenya","ODB.2013.I.INC",1,"It is apparent that there is little noticeable impact on increasing the inclusion of marginalized groups in policy making and accessing government services. This is because the government appears to have done little to educate the public concerning the existence of the open data portal and its benefits. Many Kenyans are unaware of the existence of the open data portal and they therefore do not use it. The government has also not been updating the data in the portal.

There is a project called Majidata where the poor have been involved. The Ministry of Water and Irrigation together with GIZ, UN Habitat and Google among others set it up believing that a pro-poor urban database is necessary. It informs and empowers residents of underserved low income areas as well as having  access to detailed data on their area and being able to compare their area with other low income areas. This assists residents to approach their service provider and demand for improved services and ensures the Water Service Providers prepare realistic water supply sanitation project proposals for specific low income areas.(1)

Jesuit Hakimani Centre on June 29, 2013 published a report (2) on early findings it obtained from mapping out how open data might reach marginalised communities and impact governance. From the report, there are indications of numerous initiatives at different levels of the society geared towards encouraging governments and the public sector to make their data open to the public. Research findings suggest that the citizens do seek and use government information in different domains of their lives and that more and better government information is fundamental to enhancing effective public participation in the marginalized areas covered in this study. From the study, it emerges that there is a mismatch between the data citizens want to have and the data the government and other intermediaries have availed. It is also clear from the research that most people go to local information intermediaries instead of going directly to the government data portals. Individuals living in the rural areas are much less likely to seek out government information. However, questions still abound about impact of the same. Arising issues ranged from how open data can be linked to improved service delivery to accountability and transparency. It also emerged that in some sections of the society the infrastructure on which data is accessed is important. It therefore appeared from the early findings that the gap between the data provider and users is still wide especially when it comes to disadvantaged communities who live in informal sectors.

The research carried out by Jesuit Hakimani says the Kenyans interviewed do not know about the open data government portal. Open data makes state information available to members of the public in the process addressing information gap between the government and its citizens.

With such findings, it is clear there are no noticeable positive impact of open data on the economy because the number of individuals using this information are very few. As much as the study indicates that 45.2 percent agreed that open data portal provides useful information, only 14 percent of those interviewed used the portal.

Under this circumstances, it is difficult for an entrepreneur to use the platform to build new businesses in the country. This finding arose out of an assessment carried out by iHub research. (1)

There are nevertheless some suggestions that a few entrepreneurs have used open data to build new businesses and apps in the country, for example from the former Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Information and Communication (2) (3).

"Kenya","ODB.2013.C.RTI",4,"The 2010 Kenyan Constitution is clear when it comes to Freedom of Information. Section 35 states that every citizen has the right of access to information held by the State and Information held by another person and required for the exercise or protection of any right or fundamental freedom (1). Nevertheless, accessing information from the government and its agencies remains a major challenge without a concrete law to support the implementation of the right as outlined in the Constitution.

I) The Constitution
Article 35 (2) States that every person has the right to the correction or deletion of untrue or misleading information that affects the person	
Article 35 (3) Says the State shall publish and publicise any important information affecting the nation.

The process of developing and enacting a FOI law has taken more than 10 years and is still on with various efforts by the state and civil society organizations. The Access to information bill 2012 has been developed and is in the process of being published for parliamentary debate (at the time of this research) (3).

Nevertheless, some FOI requests are honoured. A publication, Nairobi Law Monthly went to court seeking for orders compelling a state parastatal, Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen)to furnish it with information regarding certain contracts entered between it and various companies for the purpose of drilling geothermal wells. In a ruling dated May 13, 2013, a High Court Judge in Nairobi ruled that the parastatal had an obligation on request of the citizen to provide access to information under Article 35 (1) (a) of the Constitution. Justice Mumbi Ngugi said: "" A natural person who is a citizen of Kenya is entitled to seek information under Article 35 (1) (a) from the respondent (KenGen) and the respondent, unless it can show reasons related to a legitimate aim for not disclosing such information is under a constitutional obligation to provide the information sought.""

"Korea","ODB.2013.C.INIT",8,"In June 2013 the administration of President Park Geun-hye announced an initiative called ""Government 3.0,"" which calls for the release of more information disclosures before, as opposed to after, a formal request is made; 100 million information disclosures per year compared to 310,000 in 2012, the release of more data for entrepreneurial use, and the more proactive collection of private sector opinions on public sector information disclosure projects. [1] 

These changes are being put into force through the Act on Promoting Availability and the Use of Public Data, enacted in October 2013, with explicit backing from the office of the President. The Ministry of Public Security and Administration is the coordinating body with dedicated staff and budgets. [2] [3] However, as of January 2014, MOSPA has achieved what it calls a ""data opening rate” of 16 percent, or 3397 data disclosures, still too low for the government's information disclosure practices to be considered truly open, although this still marks a strong improvement. 

Given the amount of resources being put into Government 3.0 and the improvements already underway, this category deserves a high score. 

This is despite some concerns from civil society organizations over whether the President and senior government officials will resist information disclosures that cover politically sensitive topics and the Open Government Parntership IRM report notes that ""CSOs agreed that the government releases noteworthy sums of information through its open data website. However, they questioned the commitment itself, wondering why the text is unmeasurable and leaves out a list of clear deliverables.” [4]

However, in interviews during the research period, a handful of the biggest and most vocal open data and transparency CSOs said they were not consulted by the government, were not aware whom exactly was consulted, but said that they had vaguely heard of ongoing consultations regarding the ""Government 3.0"" project. 

Still, groups such as Open Net Korea and CC Korea are actively calling for better government engagement as part of a coordinated campaign, hosting a slew of open data outreach events and activities.

Interviews with civil society organizations during the research period suggest an improvement in the efficiency of information disclosure, with the new Open Data Act requiring the automatic disclosure of certain types of environment, health and non-national security information rather than always requiring an FOI request.

However, civil society organizations were also unsettled by an unusual number of state corruption and other scandals in the nation's intelligence agency, nuclear industry, and ""Four Rivers Project"" throughout the research period, suggesting that the government has not yet connected open data to a broader push for improved efficiency, delivery of public services, and anti-corruption [1].

"Korea","ODB.2013.C.DPL",8,"South Korea's regulatory framework for the protection of personal data is generally robust, and was put to the test twice in 2014 with two major data leaks. In January 2014, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) suspended three credit card firms from issuing new credit cards for three months as punishment for a leak of the personal information of 20 million people (equivalent to more than one-third of the country's population). [1] In April 2014, a second round of 17,000 information leaks occurred at Citibank and the Industrial Bank of Korea. [2] Authorities were able to punish the perpetrators swiftly thanks in part to the 2012 passage of the Personal Information Protection Act, covering both the whole of the private and public sectors for the first time and exceeding OECD standards. The law calls for mandatory data breach notifications, an explicit opt-in consent for customers in company databases, the requirement of hiring privacy compliance officers, and the right of redress through a clear and well-structured mediation system. [3] Still, one former member of the Korean Communications Commission, the body that regulates the Internet, expressed concern that South Korea is at continued risk for big data breaches, despite the improved legal framework, because online transactions often require the use of the resident registration number (RRN), the national ID code that can give hackers access to others' personal identities.

"Korea","ODB.2013.C.RTI",8,"South Korea was an early actor to to pass a freedom of information law, called the The Act on Disclosure of Information by Public Agencies, in 1996, following a 1989 Constitutional Court ruling that interpreted freedom of information to be a constitutional right. The FOI requires that civil servants respond to requests within a reasonable time frame of 10 and lays down clear administrative rules for responding to requests. However, one legal scholar specializing in FOI and transparency, Park Kyung-sin, expressed concern over vague rules that allow ministers to classify information in bulk under the authority and name of the president, hindering efforts to get the government to release more sensitive files. Furthermore, broad national security provisions in the 1948 National Security Law and other laws appear to conflict with the principles of the FOI law and 1989 Constitutional Court ruling, allowing for broad classification of material deemed sensitive for national security or North Korean affairs even if that information is in the public interest.

"Malawi","ODB.2013.C.INIT",5,"Malawi does not have a government wide Open Government Data Initiative, but there is some activity at the ministry level.

There is an on going sectoral open data initiative in which the government (the Ministry of Finance of Malawi) has partnered with AidData towards addressing the demand of increased transparency and improved geographic funding information: 'The Ministry of Finance of Malawi led the efforts to geocode the aid activities of nearly 30 donors within the Malawi Aid Management Platform. Mapping this information empowers stakeholders by enabling them to better understand the allocation of development assistance.'[1] 

There have been developments on open data movements in Malawi in that last year (July 4th, 2013) the Open Government Partnership(OGP) has accepted the government of Malawi's letter of intent sent to join  the partnership[3][4].

There is also evolving open data initiatives by the African Development Bank Group where Malawi is one of the 54 countries the regional level open data initiative has been designed for. The African Development Bank Group open data initiative right now houses limited amount of open data for 54 African countries and Malawi is one of them[2].Also, according to the reviewer, the World Bank has supported Malawi govt (Statistics Office) to build the Malawi Spatial Data Platform (‘MASDAP) (see: http://www.masdap.mw/), a cloud-based platform populated with Bank + govt-surfaced / cleaned Malawi-specific data. The current scope is environmental (natural resources, environment, water, soil, topography, etc), but their ambitions are far broader.  A 'Working Plan' has been developed to solvethe hosting issue (which also includes guidance / preferences on metadata, adding more departmental data from projects / analytical studies from WBG, and includes awareness-raising + training).  The World
 Bank has supported the development and incubation of the 'Malawi Climate Atlas' (see: http://wbes922o.worldbank.org/malawi_portal/) for eventual hand-over to govt.  It’s important to mention that the Malawi govt is considering creation of a National Data Center (i.e. all data surfaced by ministries would flow to central Center for cleaning / quality control & then (possibly) integrated onto central platform that's as-yet undeveloped, but potentially MASDAP).  Complementary efforts to support legal regimes supporting Open Data are under development.  The 'Malawi Data Working Group' (comprising reps from the National Statistical Office, Ministries, including Water, etc), and WBG are working toward these ends, including support from UNDP.  The Bank office has already provided technical training to members of the Working Group (on the functionality of the MASDAP platform) in January 2013.Malawi also has a 'GIS Working Group', driven by colleagues from Forestry. See also: Malawi Aid Mapping-
http://www.aiddata.org/content/index/Maps/malawi. The 'Open Aid Partnership is data from 24 donors has been mapped and overlaid. This initiative is affiliated with AidData(see: http://www.openaidmap.org/mappingMalawi.html).  It is likewise affiliated / linked with another aid mapping initiative in Malawi called
 the 'Aid Management Platform' (see: http://www.developmentgateway.org/about/Case-Studies/AMP-Malawi).

The implementation is underway, and Mauritius Statistics in partnership with African Development Bank have developed a Data portal in Progno platform(3). Generally, open data in Mauritius is at its nascent stage, Mauritius Statistics publishes Government Accounts(budget plan and expenditure) as open data but there is hardly any evidence to what extent opening up the data has enhanced public participation in the budget estimation and approval process, however it could be said that because of government data portals publishing budget and procurement data, policy and information transparency has been achieved to a little extent(4). Thus, there has been little impact of open data in bringing policy and information transparency in Mauritius(3).

"Mauritius","ODB.2013.I.ACCOUNT",1,"The significant step that Mauritius has made with respect to Open data is the e-Government strategy which it has developed recently(1). The e-Government strategy is underway, with the limited number of datasets published(budget related data) as open data it could be said that information and policy transparency to an extent have been achieved (2). Though not in an open data format the National Assembly of the Republic of Mauritius has the habit of publishing its assembly session in PDF format which shows the country's culture of transparency is not entirely the availability of open data (3).

"Mauritius","ODB.2013.I.ENV",0,"Open data initiatives in Mauritius are limited or just in the process of taking roots(1,2). The only notable effort so far is the availability of Statistical Data Portal in Prognoz platform- the Statistics Mauritius in partnership with the African Development Bank has developed a data portal which offers open access to documents(3) besides online data search or queries. The data portal offers access to environment statistical reports or publication digests  which are available only in PDF format(non-machine readable format). However, for instance there is no clear associations of open data movements and environment sustainable development campaigns held annually with the motto ""Clean Up the World 2013"" which is celebrated in the third week of September(4). However, the publication of  environmental statistics report and digests, and making them accessible online by itself even if the publication is not available in machine readable format can still have an impact of the lowest margin.

"Mexico","ODB.2013.C.DPL",7,"Mexico has a legal regulatory data protection framework for information possessed by the government and private sector. For information held by the government, persons have the right to correct one personal’s data or to access information such as medical records in government healthcare facilities. Laws and regulatory framework impose clear responsibilities to violators. Additionally, there is a right of redress against both private and public bodies that violate data privacy. Finally, any person can file a complaint to the Instituto Federal de Acceso a la Información Pública y Protección de Datos (IFAI). Cases solved by IFAI related to data protection can be found here through a search engine (1)

Legal framework includes the following:
-	Federal Transparency and Access to Information Law. 
-	Regulatory framework regarding the Transparency and Access to Information Law. 
-	Rulings of the Mexican Access to Information Institute. 
-	Federal Data Protection Law for Private Entities.
-	Regulatory framework regarding the Federal Data Protection Law for Private Entitties. 
-	General Criteria on the matter established by IFAI. 
-	Recommendations generated by IFAI on data protection. 

The framework is in the beginning stages and people is just becoming aware of the their right for privacy.
A group of lawmakers has asked also to include in the General Law on Personal Data Protection issues as: the right to be forgotten, managing databases, information about dead people, how the judicial authorities will use the security cameras and geolocation, as well as guidelines on social networks.

"Morocco","ODB.2013.C.INIT",5,"There is an open data initiative in Morocco.

The report highlights, regarding data.gov.ma: ""Despite its innovative nature, the Moroccan open data initiative did not enjoy the interest it deserved; the released datasets are/have remained very limited. This situation is certainly related to the fact that the initiative has been led by a governmental entity [alone] and in a very isolated fashion, without being inscribed in any true governmental strategy and [promoted] through a very insufficient communication"" (p. 31)."
"Morocco","ODB.2013.I.GOV",2,"No specific cases of impact, however, one can assume that there is some impact from the reuse of open datasets shared by several organizations and government such as :

The project in progress ""MADARISSOUNA"" (An initiative of an ONG) of the reuse of datasets related to the list of schools and other related informations will give a better visibility on the current state to identify the needs in terms of :

However, in August 2014, Morocco’s govt. approved the draft law on Right of Access to Information :

""Morocco’s cabinet on Thursday endorsed the draft law 31-13 on the right of access to information.The draft law, submitted by the Minister-Delegate for Public Service and Administration Modernization, has been endorsed according to chapter 27 of the new constitution, which classifies it within the essential rights and freedoms that ought to be respected. This draft law aims at promoting participatory democracy by encouraging citizens to participate in the control of the administrative action and decision making, Communication minister, Government Spokesperson, Mustapha El Khalfi, said at a press briefing following the cabinet meeting.
This draft law defines the nature of the information, the access process, exceptions and proactive measures to ensure the dissemination of information in a bid order to consolidate the right of access to information."" (5-8)

"Myanmar","ODB.2013.C.INIT",0,"There isn't any official open data initiative in Myanmar. This is not surprising given the culture of secrecy that the country lived in for may decades until 2013, when some signs of change were seen. Before any meaningful OD initiatives to happen, the legal system regarding information and internet governance needs to be reformed (http://wvw.burmalibrary.org/docs15/Burma_Code-Vol-II-ocr-tu.pdf, p182-189). According to Waltraut Ritter from Knowledge Dialogues and Opendata Hong Kong/Open Knowledge Foundation Hong Kong, who recently visited Myanmar, there is currently a great opportunity to introduce open data initiatives in Myanmar: the country is conducting its first nationwide census in 31 years. This is a good start because data about livelihood, economy, and exact size of the many ethnic groups in the country is vague.

"Myanmar","ODB.2013.C.CSOC",3,"As mentioned in C1, there isn't really any OD initiatives in the country. However, according to Waltraut Ritter, Myanmar has an active civil society working on various aspects of information society, from press freedom to civic-driven public libraries, such as Beyond Access, an organization that aims to transform the country’s vast network of 5000 public libraries into connected information and service hubs, MIDO (Myanmar ICT development organization, which organized the first internet freedom forum in Yangon last year), and the Myanmar Blogger Society, which now collaborates with telecom provider Ooredoo. Furthermore, Open Myanmar Initiative is a non-profit organisation with the vision of promoting the right to information and to education -- a prerequisite to get each and every citizen involved in Myanmar's transition towards the future where peace prevails and democracy prospershttp://www.omimyanmar.org/#. Finally, some international organizations are pushing the open data agenda in the country. For example, the World Bank organized a workshop in June 2013 where More than 120 members from civil society organisations, research institutes and government ministries participated in the recent “Open Development” workshop organised by the World Bank, as part of its on-going efforts to encourage the use of publicly accessible data and research, found in the Bank’s website, to tackle development challenges. According to an official statement, there is increasing demand for greater transparency, accountability and governance. http://www.futuregov.asia/articles/2013/jun/27/world-bank-promotes-open-data-myanmar/.
Finally, in March 2014, the first ever hackathin was organized:  After an intense 48 hours, Myanmar’s first-ever hackathon finished at 6pm on Sunday, March 16. The hackathon, which was organized by Code for Change Myanmar and supported by Internews, brought together 76 of Myanmar’s most talented young developers, designers and entrepreneurs. https://www.internews.org/young-coders-astound-judges-myanmar-first-ever-hackathon

These networks and organisations could play an important role in building the soft infrastructure of the future information society and open data initiatives..

The interim constitution as well as the Right to Information Act 2007 ensures right to information, but citizens may not receive timely responses to requests for government information, or responses are missing key information. The legal provisions are not put to practice in letter and spirit. Although the RTI law is in place, the implementation part is weak. Most citizens tend to think that it is only for journalists and lawyers and not for ordinary people.

"Norway","ODB.2013.C.INIT",8,"Norway has participated in OGP since the initiative was taken in 2010. They also participated when the partnership was launched in New York in September in 2011.The Foreign Ministry in Norway was originally in charge of coordinating the work with OGP in Norway. The responsibility was turned over to The Ministry of Government Administration, Reform and Church Affairs in January 2013. Norway is currently implementing the 1st and developing the 2nd action plans(7)

Also, Norway is ranked 4th by the Open Data Index of the Open Knowledge Foundation.
Regarding the criteria:
- The government discloses data or information without request from citizens. This may be according to a release schedule or ad hoc: There is a government-funded website and database with open data and information available from different governmental and non-governmental sources (2). The information is released even without request from citizens. A large number of public bodies have published data (4)
- The Internet is the primary means of disclosure. Mobile phone applications may also be used for disclosure: The Internet is the main media of delivery of open data (2).
- Data is free to access and re-use, e.g. open licenses: The hosting website suggests that data are provided under the Norwegian Licence for Open Government Data (2)
- Data is in a machine-readable format to enable computer-based reuse, e.g. spreadsheet formats, Application Programming Interface (API): Different types of machine-readable formats are available. Some cases offer API, like the Statistics Norway (3).

A policy statement is published by the Ministry for Local Government and Modernisation (5). There are certain shortcomings, mainly because the initiatives are still recent and didn't have time to show an effect (6).

Criteria:

The biggest newspaper analysed, published and reported data from reports about kindergartens in Norway (1). This could have contributed to changes that took place in the responsible authorities of the kindergartens from the municipalities to the counties (2). There is also the example of the Norwegian Public Roads Administration that offers data about the road network as open source. One example of increasing effectiveness is that it is possible through their own app that is using the Open Dataset, to suggest correction in the data about roads (3). Another example was the changes in the firefighters structure possibly as a response to articles from the newspaper VG (4) based on data available by the Directorate of Civil protection (5). In another example from 2012, the same newspaper published the budget of the ministries and asked the readers to report suspicious or problematic expenses (6). There were at least many stories published based on tips from the readers and some of them made the government to respond and re-evaluate cases/expenses.

The Norwegian Company register opened a lot of their data in 2012 and there has been huge uptake by businesses for e-invoicing. There are over 190,000 page views per week on average on their API, a high rate given the population of Norway is 5 million[2][3]. 

The most popular datasets for apps are weather data (which has been opened for over 5 years in Norway)and traffic data. The National Roads Authority has opened up their entire database – (the same database which they use internally!) and this is proving very popular. Also there are a number of real time transport apps[1].

- It is free of charge: yes (4)
- Evidence that citizens generally receive responses to requests for government information within the legally stipulated time as governed by the RTI / FOI law and at the cost defined by law: The Parliamentary Omdudsman mentions in the report of activities from 2013 that many complaints regard no answer or missing information from the authorities (3). There is also discussion regarding the unwillingness/inability of some municipalities to comply (3)
- The responses are typically of acceptable quality. 
- An RTI law or similar legal right enshrines the right to such requests: The law gives the right to such requests (4).
- There is a dedicated agency that adjudicates cases that are refused by the government: The Parliamentary Ombudsman is responsible for final evaluation of complaints for the public sector (2). To file a complain is free of charge and can be done electronically.
- This role is taken seriously and there is evidence of its work being effective and respected. The Parliamentary Ombudsman's report for 2013 shows that there are around 3000 cases processed, and that the outcome of the decisions are generally respected (3).
- There can be exceptions in which information is not released to protect national security or public interests clearly prescribed by law (e.g., medical records, sexual orientation, etc.), but the legal reason must be stated clearly in the response from the government to the citizen who requested the information: This is described in the law (4).

Regarding the low RTI rating, there have been identified weaknesses regarding the lack promotional measures, lack of sanctions, the requesting procedures, the scope and the exceptions from the law (1). The RTI rating is describing the law, and not the actual situation, whilst the Web Index criteria have been answered based on evidence of the current situation in Norway. In municipality level there are problems with the implementation of the law, despite the clear inclusion of the municipal authorities in the juristriction of the law.

This site will be run by de Public Management Secretary (Secretaría de Gestión Pública), (3) which depends on the Presidency of the Cabinet, but lacks staff and budget, provided mainly by Inter-American Development Bank and Germany cooperation (2).

To promote and provide open data, it created a Task Force (composed of the Office of the Presidential Spokesperson, the Department of Budget and Management, and the Presidential Communications Development and Strategic Planning Office) and came up with an action plan up to the year 2016.

The Open Data Philippines Task Force promises to put online certain data sets for the public to have access to.

Some observers (especially advocates of the FOI Bill), though, are saying that there must be a more permanent structure (than a Task Force) and that data will be made open to the public must be more comprehensive and diverse. The existing setup is designed as such that it is only the government that determines which data or information are to be made open.

A visit of the DBM website would allow one to look at the .pdf copy of the country's appropriations and funds that DBM has released so far. The country's spending watchdog, the Commission on Audit, also has in its website .pdf copy of its reports and circulars. These file types are hard to use if one has to make analysis and evaluation of the data provided and by categorization of this survey are not considered open data. Unless more appropriate open data types are provided by these agencies, the public or any third party would have enormous difficulty making use and sense of these data. (2)

Since the Lisbon Treaty came into effect, the principle of protection of personal data of every physical person is also contained in the regulation of fundamental importance for the Union which is the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union - art. 16 provides that ""Every person has the right to protection personal data concerning him or her.""
Issues concerning the protection of personal data were implemented in the Polish law for the first time in 1997 - in art. 51 of the Polish Constitution of 2 April 1997 and - in a comprehensive manner - in the Act of 29 August 1997 on the protection of personal data. In addition to the basic law on the protection of personal data, other Regulations are in effect, of which the most important from the perspective of businesses processing personal data is the Regulation of the Minister of Internal Affairs and Administration of 29 April 2004 on personal data processing documentation and technical and organizational conditions which should be fulfilled by devices and systems used for the processing of personal data and the Ordinance of the Minister of Internal Affairs and Administration of 11 December 2008 on the design of a data set to the Inspector General for Personal Data Protection.

Based on the research of open datasets and the open data context, it is fair to say that this phenomenon is still very timid in Portugal and, even though a few apps and websites have been developed using open data, it is very unlikely that they have already produced a positive impact on the economy.

"Portugal","ODB.2013.I.ACCOUNT",3,"Even though no studies were found on the impact of open data on increasing transparency and accountability in Portugal, a few examples of cases found in the media show that the BASE Portal (a government platform for public contracts) has allowed the disclosure of important stories to the public (through investigative journalism) which otherwise would have not been possible (with these media articles actually citing the BASE Portal as the official source) In that sense, it is fair to say that open data has had a noticeable impact on increasing transparency and accountability, although there is room for improvement.

There are, however, several exemptions which allow the collection and processing of personal data without the data subject's consent.

The Portuguese Constitution, Article 37: Freedom of Expression and Information specifically says that every citizen has the right to inform, to get informed and to be informed, without any impediments nor discrimination. (3) 

However, some gaps remain. For example, the electronic version of the official gazette charges very high fees for advance search options (such as search in natural language) and only allows PDF versions of the official gazette's pages. (4)

Several agencies provide government information. The ""Loja do Cidadão"" is one important vehicle between citizens and the government. (5)

No statistics on data/requests handling: frequency of replies, time length etc. were found.

"Qatar","ODB.2013.C.INIT",4,"A national portal exists but it does not seem to comprehend what open format and licensing mean as data is solely provided as PDFs and Excel sheets, and is the property of the Government. (The portal basically redirects the user to the country’s national statistics website.) Information requests can be made through the portal.(1)

Thus, Qatar does not have a structured and well-resourced open government data initiative. It has however launched a public consultation on 9 March 2014 asking for input regarding its draft Open Data Policy (2). A more detailed assessment and discussion of the Policy draft can be accessed on OpenMENA.(3)

I could not obtain an answer from the Ministry of ICT in Qatar regarding the amount of input and what the next steps are especially given that the initial deadline for responses to the consultation seems removed. Yet, the public consultation on Open Data policy suggests an implicit understanding of the advantages and uses of open data, hence the score of 3 rather than 1.

A phone discussion with Damian Radcliff from ictQatar (March 2014) revealed that there have been very low response rate to the public consultation on the Open Data Policy draft from Qatari professionals. This low responsiveness may very well be the reason behind a seemingly open-end consultation.

The News&Events portal of the ictQatar may help keeping up-to-date.(1)

A recent report by Tahseen Consulting also highlighted the lack of inclusion: ""Relative to OECD countries, most GCC governments focus on national data portals rather than regional and city initiatives, have not enacted right to information laws, fail to engage civil society and academia in efforts, and lack education and training courses for developing more effective open data programs, the report says.""

Lastly, an Open Data Institute node was inaugurated in November 2013 in Dubai. From informal discussions with its founder Ibrahim Elbadawi (December 2013), the node will help run training sessions on Open Data for government officials. Elbadawi also highlighted the lack of readiness of government officials in the field of Open Data which is a concern with respect to the proposed draft Policy.(3)

A possibly relevant training program was organized a few years ago by Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI) in partnership with the University of Chicago as part of the Eric & Wendy Schmidt Data Science for Social Good summer fellowship programme (DSSG). A total of 36 aspiring data scientists will work closely with experts in data mining, machine learning and data science projects as part of the DSSG programme.

There is full provision for the protection of users privacy, both for communications and user data. Service providers are responsible for protecting user privacy and for keeping user data up-to-date and accurate. 

Both the Telecom Act and Bylaws allow for private data or communications to be disclosed or monitored in cases permitted or required by Saudi law (governed by principles of Shari'a, which prohibits the invasion of a person's privacy).
 
Privacy thus seems to be protected thanks to a few Acts and laws. Yet, a unified system to protect privacy of data is missing making understanding of someone's rights and responsibilities difficult. Importantly, there is no safety net against state surveillance. The need to add data protection in the Saudi law has been talked about but apparently with no interest to materialise.

(a) the individual to whom the information relates gives prior consent;
(b) the disclosure is required to promote public health or public safety;
(c) the disclosure is necessary in order to subject public authorities and private bodies to public scrutiny;
(d) the disclosure is made to the individual to whom the information relates;
(e) the disclosure can reasonably be expected not to have an adverse effect on the affairs of any person or prejudice the future supply of the information;
(f) the information is already available to the public;
(g) the individual to whom the information relates was informed or made aware prior to supplying the information that the information belongs to a class of information (1).

Furthermore, according to Centre for Accountability and Rule of Law (2013), Data Protection Act is needed to give leverage to the Right to Access Information Act. This implies that Sierra Leone lacks the Data Protection Policy (2).

In addition to the above, Sierra Leone is part of the ECOWAS which has a legal framework for data protection for all the countries that make up ECOWAS (3).

"Singapore","ODB.2013.C.INIT",7,"Singapore has an open data initiative launched on 20 June 2011. It is available at http://data.gov.sg/home.aspx.
data.gov.sg brings together over 8600 datasets from 60 government ministries and agencies – the number datasets increased by 60% since the initiative started. It was initiated by the Ministry of Finance along with the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore . The government committed to expand the amount of data shared in June 2013, and to work towards making all datasets on data.gov.sg and OneMap machine-readable – up from the then 50 per cent by the end of 2013.(1)

The initiative offers free, accessible, machine-readable data stored in open standards, but the government has a “terms of use”(2), keeps the right of data removal without notice, and requires app developers to register. The data is released in a timely fashion, but its primacy is questionable as data collection methods are not always disclosed. The data is also incomplete as certain “sensitive” areas (e.g. race, religion, finances) are not included.
As there is clear commitment to the open data initiative both in principle and in terms of resources, but the initiative does not fulfill the requirements of the common 10 open data principles(3), score 7 seems appropriate.

"Singapore","ODB.2013.C.CSOC",2,"According to the Open Knowledge Foundation’s Open Data Index (28 Oct 2013)(2), Singapore gained 335 points (1) (identical to Tunisia and Bangladesh), and was ranked in the lowest third of the analyzed 70 countries in terms of the openness of its government data. Regardless of the expansion of the initiative in Singapore, this score signals that the available data is still quite limited and primarily consists of areas where the government expects productive applications to develop – e.g. transport, emissions, and statistics. 

It was this productivity/efficiency-driven argument, which led to the development of Singapore’s open data initiative, which was brought forward by the government “on its own”, and not because civil society demanded it in an organized fashion. CSOs have been criticizing the government for its lack of transparency for a long time(3)(4), but there was no organized movement for “open data”, hence score 2 seems appropriate.

Urban Prototyping (UP) Singapore, which organizes “civic“ hackathons and related events received the New Initiative Grant from the National Volunteer & Philanthropy Centre in 2013. Thematic UP Singapore events are often supported by the relevant government agencies - e.g. National Environmental Agency – “Clean and Green” hackathon in Nov 2013 (200 participants). 

In August 2013, the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) organised the Singapore Geospatial Challenge (SGC) which introduced gamification components to make GIST more fun and accessible to over 350 Secondary and Junior College students from 40 schools. SLA also launched the GeoInnovation Fund in October 2013, where students and apps developers can apply for up to SG$50,000 (US$ 40,000 ) in funding to develop their geospatial apps. Six government agencies offer the Singapore Geospatial Scholarship(2) for undergraduate and postgraduate studies to allow recipients to develop a geospatial career with exposure in various public agencies.(3)

As these efforts are extensive, well-funded and driven by multiple agencies, score 10 is appropriate.

"Singapore","ODB.2013.C.SUPIN",0,"In Singapore, town councils come the closest to the idea of a local government. Town Councils were formed in 1989 to empower local elected representatives and residents to run their own Housing Development Board estates. (1)
 
A Town Council consists of all the MPs for the constituencies making up the town. In addition, the chairman of the Town Council can appoint (i) between 6 and 30 members as Town Councilors, or (ii) up to 10 Town Councilors per MP, whichever is the greater. To ensure that the Town Council's decisions reflect the views of the residents, at least two-thirds of the appointed members must be residents. Town Councils control, manage, maintain and improve the common areas of residential and commercial properties in HDB housing estates within the town. (2) 

I randomly selected five town council websites (out of 16), and checked them for open data initiatives, but for no avail. The same is true for the central town council website. On data.gov.sg there is no dataset shared by town councils.

Ideally, this question should not apply for Singapore, which is a city state. If an answer must be given, the appropriate score is 0 as the town councils don’t have their own open data initiatives.

Training on data technology, data science, statistics, and data visualization are available at most universities and polytechnics both as part of degree programs and professional development courses.  

At the National University of Singapore – Computer Engineering BSc program “Data Structures and Algorithms I” is a required subject (3), and among “Large Scale Computing” electives there are several data related subjects. (4)

At the Nanyang Technological University, “Data structures” is a required course of the Computer Engineering BSc program. (5)

At Singapore Management University (SMU), the School of Information Systems offers several courses, including customized professional programs like “Workshop on Geospatial Analytics for Healthcare” and “Programming Interactive Data Visualization for the Web.” (6)

Dell, Intel and Revolution Analytics(2) have set up a Big Data Innovation Center in the country; and NTUC also offers courses related to data management – the range of educational options is very diverse. In terms of the business and legal aspects of open data, the opportunities are less obvious. App developers use open data in Singapore extensively – more than 110 apps were created so far, some for commercial use. Open data is still limited in Singapore, hence the legal challenges are limited – data protection and intellectual property law are covered as part of the curriculum at the tertiary legal training programs.

As education and access information is widespread and high quality but lacks an explicit open data angle, score 7 is appropriate.

"Singapore","ODB.2013.I.GOV",3,"There is very limited proof that open data had an impact on increasing government efficiency and effectiveness in Singapore. To start with, Singaporean public administration is very efficient – as the country’s leading position in many global rankings attest. At the same time, the government lacks transparency, and does not share politically sensitive or financial information through its government websites or open data initiative. The government uses data visualization and data analytics tools(1), and better internal data management, but there is no clear link between its open data initiative and efficiency.

According to Capgemini Consulting(2), Singapore falls into the “Followers” category in terms of its open data initiative (measured based on data availability and the usability of its data portal). “‘Followers’ typically include nations that have shown their intention and progressive approach towards Open Data by releasing a large number of datasets. They also provide better search functionality on their portals, which makes it easy to obtain data. These countries also experience better interaction with the user community, generally one-way communication, on their Open Data portals.” Within the group Singapore has relatively high portal usability and lower data availability.

"Singapore","ODB.2013.I.ACCOUNT",0,"There is no proof for any noticeable impact of open data on transparency or accountability in Singapore. Among the applications on data.gov.sg there are no apps related to transparency or accountability. Budget data is only available in sectoral terms and not on a transactional/program basis in most cases, which is also a constraint on the development of such apps.(2)

The Open Data Barometer 2013 (3) ranks Singapore 29th out of 77 countries, though Singapore scores poorly on the Impact sub-index. The report also points out that “civil society readiness is notably lower in Singapore” (as compared to government and private sector readiness) to secure benefits from open data.

The situation is similar to what the blogger Yawning Bread has described in 2011, when Singapore’s open data initiative was launched: “It does not surprise me that what we have is mimicry without any understanding at all of the substance; wanting (once again) to look like a modern, developed, liberal democratic country without letting go of authoritarian, control-freak habits.”(1)

The 2014 Arachnys Open Data Compass (3) suggests that “corporate and litigation data has been effectively privatised behind member-only paywalls” in Singapore. Singapore is also found to be an outlier of the trend that economic development level and open data availability correlate.

As limited evidence is available, score 1 is appropriate.

2.Existing, large companies also rely on open data as part of their newly developing data industry practices – e.g. Siemens, IBM. Again, profitability is not proven(1), and experts are often ""imported"" as local talent is currently still scarce.(4)

"Singapore","ODB.2013.C.DPL",6,"Personal data in Singapore is protected under the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (PDPA)(2). The PDPA was passed in Parliament on 15 October 2012 and brought into effect on 2 January 2013. The Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) has set up a Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) and a Data Protection Advisory Committee on 2 January 2013 to respectively administer, and advise on the PDPA. Provisions relating to the DNC Registry came into effect on 2 January 2014 and the main data protection rules will come into force on 2 July 2014.(1)

In terms of the PDPA’s features:
1. Broad applicability
The data protection provisions don’t apply to public agencies and individuals acting in a personal basis, hence the law is not broadly applicable. 
2. The right of choice/consent
The concepts of consent and purpose are taken into account in Singapore’s PDPA.
3. The right to access and correct
With certain exceptions, it is possible to request access to personal information – organizations can charge for this on a cost recovery basis. Similarly correction can be requested, but no fee can imposed by organizations.
4. The responsibilities of information holders
PDPA regulates these responsibilities.
5. The right of redress
Redress and oversight is provided by the PDPC, which is a statutory board.

As the PDPA does not apply to public institutions (because they already have their own set of data protection rules with which all public officers must comply), have narrower applicability than best practice requires, and is currently being enrolled, score 5 seems appropriate.

Nevertheless, Singapore government agencies have informative and regularly updated websites, which provide detailed and free information on various issues. The government also launched REACH (reaching everyone for active citizenry@ home) in October 2006 when the Feedback Unit was restructured to move beyond gathering public feedback, to become the lead agency for engaging and connecting with citizens. REACH was also appointed as the Singapore Government’s e-engagement platform in January 2009. (3)

Responsiveness is also part of the Singapore civil service’s KPI (key performance indicator) structure. For example, part of the Police’s “Service Pledge” is: “To provide full replies to clear-cut enquiries from the Public within 3 working days” and “To respond to letters from the public within 5 working days”.

Another example is more specifically related to open knowledge and had a big impact: The use of open textbooks in South Africa has saved approximately $30m annually. Another example of sharing medicine prices between SADC countries has shown initial costs savings of $2.5m annual with potentially much more in the future. But these examples are isolated and “open data is generally not well understood within the country” (2).

It is not clear whether this is through “open data” or not. Civic society sources a great deal of its own data (1). In terms of toilet facilities and access to services like water and garbage collection, the Census has proved to be a very powerful tool (1)(3).

"Spain","ODB.2013.C.INIT",6,"The Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism - through the Public Enterprise Red.es - in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance and Public Administration, launched the project Aporta in 2009. The main objective of the project was to create the necessary conditions to foster a culture for the re-use of public information, laying the groundwork to enable administrative units to make their data and documents available to third parties and promoting the development of the newly founded infomediary market sector. 

All the actions being carried out under the project are permanently aligned with the guidelines and best practices provided by reference institutions such as the World Wide 
Web Consortium (W3C). Among these actions we could highlight the following ones:
 
Set up of the National Public Information Catalog (datos.gob.es) launched in October 2011 and currently hosting up to 3,500 datasets from more than 100 different bodies - including central, regional and local governments – as well as close to 70 applications based on data provided by the catalog. The website was awarded as the most friendly PSI portal in the European Union by LAPSI and with the European prize for innovation in public administration. 

A series of training activities associated with data re-use for more than 200 participants, as well as the corresponding companion guidance materials such as the practical guide for the Royal Decree Law 37/2007 - that facilitates compliance with this Act - or the Implementation Guide for the Technical Interoperability Standard. 

Support and expert advice to public bodies in order to ensure compliance with current re-use legislation. Over 1,500 inquires were handled through this service, as well as around 120 face-to-face visits in which operational and technical doubts has been resolved. More that 25 open data action plans for different Government Agencies (1) where also developed. 

Different actions to promote the culture of openness and information reuse through several online channels – including reference social networks – as well as by means of the annual Open Data meetup (2) with the full stakeholders community to share experiences and best practices on data re-use. 

It is also worth to mention the study “Demand and use of Open Government in Spain” (3) were open government data demand side from civil society is explored in deep. 

Furthermore, The Digital Agenda for Spain (4), approved on February 15th 2013, includes a series of key actions focused on increasing the publication of high-impact datasets held by the Public Administration in the next years, as well as to increase the number of individual and business that make use of such data for commercial or non-commercial purposes, that is, to strengthen the infomediary sector in the country.

The reuse of public sector information is also an important part of the ""Plan Avanza 2 - 2015” (5) strategy, that provides the general framework for the implementation of information and communication technologies as a social instrument.

As a result, an increasing number of government agencies are starting to promote their own Open Data initiatives, such in the case of AEMET, the National Tax Agency, the National statistics institute, the Public Service of Employment, the Official Gazette or several Ministries to name a few.

There is also a recent deep study from the Orange Foundation on the current situation of regional and local governments with regards to Open Data (6)

"Spain","ODB.2013.C.CSOC",7,"There is a growing community (1) willing to engage with the government, examples are:

Catalunya Dades: Composed by a wide range of stakeholders in Catalonia that seeks the active participation of society member in the process of value creation from open knowledge and open data. 
Civio: A civil society organization promoting transparency and open access to public data for every individual and organization. 
OKFN -ES: One of the local chapters of the Open Knowledge Foundation Network, a worldwide leader in Open Data and Open Knowledge communities. It has also very active subgroups in the fields of Data Journalism and Open Universities. 
Open Data Spain: A W3C Community Group that serves as a public forum where administrations, citizens and industry come together and create synergies to discuss issues related to public sector information. 
OpenKratio: A motivated citizen action group with the main objective of inculcate in society the principles of Open Government and Open Data through dissemination, participation, collaboration and outreach initiatives, as well as specific projects development. 

Also the Confederation of Rectors of Spanish Universities (2) is heavily promoting Open Data internally and engaging with government for that.
Another interesting example is the first OKF-es awards (3), combining categories for public and private institutions.

Nevertheless, participation and engagement of the society with government is still not as much as desirable, especially at the national level. There is no way of indicating which datasets should be released (just some isolated efforts) and this lack of feedback is preventing a better re-use of resources (human and material ones). That is why this point should be improved in the next years. It is also necessary to say that there is good number of contests, etc. to get people involved in the movement but people should be involved in early stages not just in the last part of consumption. As an example the UK government provides a way to communicate the wishes of the citizens regarding datasets, something that is still missing in Spain or, at least, it is not fully implemented.

-Open Data Lab Gijón (1)
-Open Data contest in Castilla y León (2)
-Famelab Spain (3)
-Maddata Madrid (4)
-Data journalism and open data (5)

The aforementioned ones are just a small sample of all initiatives that public administrations and other organizations are carrying out. That is why I consider that the disseminating activities are making a very good job, although the final impact can be improved.

"Spain","ODB.2013.C.SUPIN",7,"In the case of Spain, the Open Data movements grew up from the local and regional institutions to the national ones (a bottom-up approach) while in other countries such as UK a top-down approach was followed to unify criteria, guidelines, etc. This situation has implied a very good number of initiatives but without the reuse of previous efforts and experience creating a tangled environment of datasets, catalogues, technology and so on.  In this context the open data map (1) and some of the reports of the Aporta project (2) (3) shows a very healthy activity in local and regional governments (although there is much more at stake than the public ones). The main drawback lies in the diversity of every approach but the initial effort has been already made.

As a result, most of the regional governments and an increasing number of local ones, are currently running their own Open Data initiatives (5-26) with more to be coming on a continuously basis.

"Spain","ODB.2013.C.TRAIN",7,"Gaining momentum in the ICT sector, the Open Data movement has got the attraction of different parties. That is why some courses, hands-on sessions, online courses, tutorials, etc. are continuously being delivered by both public organizations and private institutions (1-107), although quite basic in most of the cases.

Nevertheless, there is also some courses on Big Data and Linked Data that somehow have common points with Open Data and most of times these courses are focused on ""X data"". Besides, most courses should be delivered from both technical and strategical (legislation) points of view.

Finally, a big number of that courses are focusing on some specific topic such as data journalism (5). In the same way a distinction between creation, consumption, tools, etc. should be made to take the most of courses and data. There is also a very good example of training materials repository for that by Civio (8)

However I am not very sure about how much efficiency open data has reached. It is well known that some sources that kept similar information but not unified such as Postal Codes, the Land information (""Catastro"") (1) and the different GIS have got the opportunity of unifying this very valuable data. On the other hand some areas such as budgeting or public contracts (2) have also increased their efficiency since a common framework is available (see question of Procurement Platforms). Finally other sources such as the geographical information, climate (4), etc. and in general all statistics by the National Institute of Statistics (INE) (3) have also seen an increase in their efficiency (shared and reuse).

"Spain","ODB.2013.C.DPL",9,"There is a legal framework in Europe that has been transposed to Spain through the well-known act LOPD (1). Article 18.4 of the Spanish Constitution (4) also specifies that “the law will limit the use of computer technology to guarantee the honor, and personal and family privacy of citizens and their exercise of their rights”. The Spanish Data Protection Agency, which depends on the Spanish Ministry of Justice, was created in 1993 to protect privacy and ensure compliance of the Organic Law for personal data protection. This law is broadly applicable, provides the right of choice and consent to individuals as well as the right to access and correct information and the right of redress. It also outlines the responsibilities of information holders. Spain´s AEPD (5) regularly releases reports and recommendations both for users and firms to prevent uncontrolled circulation of personal data.

Furthermore last times have seen how Google (2) must remove all personal data from their servers (3) if an Europen Citizen required it. So in that sense European citizens and Spanish ones are generally protected.

Meetings within this forum are regularly held and are open for actors with an interest in open data, such as organisations and companies that work with or plan to work with open data. The forums also targeted business/organisation developers, and IT-developers and managers. Target audiences were business and civil society actors. (http://www.vinnova.se/PageFiles/591806061/N2012-3599-ITP%20VINNOVAs%20delredovisning%20%C3%B6ppendata%20se.pdf).

VINNOVA has recently published an analysis of public efforts within open data (http://www.vinnova.se/upload/EPiStorePDF/vr_14_04.pdf), and a number of other government agencies are reviewing their activities within the field and report to the government. (http://www.vinnova.se/sv/Aktuellt--publicerat/Publikationer/Produkter/Oppna-data-2014/)

As it seems, the Swedish government is very active in promoting open data."
"Sweden","ODB.2013.C.CITY",7,"VINNOVA - the Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems - is in practice the government agency in charge of promoting open data. (There are other major players, but of less relevance in this context). 

As the general government agency for innovation, open data is part of VINNOVA's mission to promote growth and innovation in Sweden. Such promotion is made in a number of ways, where financial ones are of main concern here. Thus, the agency finances research, and resources are granted on application. Whereas open data should be financed as part of VINNOVA's annual ""grants"" of 3,7 billion Swedish crowns, it is unclear to what share of these funds open data receives. However, there is a clear and equally accessible opportunity for funding. (http://www.vinnova.se/en/About-VINNOVA/)

As for public events and other government measures to promote open data, including private sector use, please see justification under question C4 above."
"Sweden","ODB.2013.C.SUPIN",8,"The Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (henceforth SKL) is the national organisation for city (municipality) and regional governments. SKL is actively promoting and coordinating open data. (http://www.skl.se/vi_arbetar_med/e-samhallet/oppnadata)

There is a municipal network for open data, which coordinates local open data programs, with support from VINNOVA. (http://www.skl.se/vi_arbetar_med/e-samhallet/oppnadata/samordning-av-oppna-data)

As the principle of public access to official documents is so fundamental to Swedish society, city and regional governments are most unlikely not to promote the development of open data. Thus, the use of open data is a natural continuation and consequence of applying abovementioned principle on national, regional, and local levels. To the contrary, there is a fear that European Union laws and regulations may impair Swedish public access to open data, which would be contrary to Swedish tradition. (http://www.svt.se/nyheter/i-dag-inskranks-offentlighetsprincipen)"
"Sweden","ODB.2013.C.TRAIN",7,"There is quite a number of courses both by universities and private actors to train in the use of open data. However, there is no readily accessible overview of the scope and availability of such training. A simple thing as a Google search  in Swedish on open data courses results in some 285,000 hits. Still, whereas it would be reasonable to assume a very high score for Sweden on such training, it is seems rather hard to determine just how high."
"Sweden","ODB.2013.I.GOV",6,"This is a question where everyone claims that open data has great impact, but there is little or no evidence that so is actually the case. Everyone believes, including me, that this is the case, and experience it in everyday life, but evaluations are lacking, because the impact is ""felt"".  

Whereas the Swedish government, in line with the country's administrative tradition, has made great efforts to make material, that would be readily accessible in contact with authorities, available online, there is little analysis of what impact this had had on government efficiency and effectiveness. This tradition of government openness and transparency, laid down by the constitution already in the 18th century, will inevitably complicate any analysis of change in how open data has had a noticeable impact on increasing government efficiency and effectiveness. It has simply been a natural step to make information available online that has for long been readily available offline. 

However, subjectively, measures to enhance the use of open data are obvious in everyday life, for most parts of society. It is reasonable to assume that this has had great effect to increase transparency and lower transaction costs. As stated, there is though a lack of thorough analysis to what extent this has had an impact on government efficiency and effectiveness.

To this end, Statskontoret, the government's survey support, has been charged to do a follow up of effects for making official material available as open data by 2015. (http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c6/23/90/06/cd061d05.pdf)

In an assessment of the government e-delegation, an e-governance coordinative body, Statskontoret argues that there are great opportunities to increase quality and efficiency in public administration by use of e.g. open data, and points to the central strategic role of e-governance. Focus is still on coordination, continuous political support and further financing. http://www.statskontoret.se/upload/Publikationer/2014/201412.pdf"
"Sweden","ODB.2013.I.ACCOUNT",4,"Any change between the situation before open data and with open data is very difficult, as the same information has been available all along, with the mere difference that it is now available online as open data. So, I would personally argue that change is twofold: 1) Increased availablity; and 2) Increased technical opportunities for computation and analysis.

A 2010 paper argues that Sweden ranks no. 4 in e-government as an instrument for more accountable and transparent local governments. (http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1542308) This analysis is rather similar to content and structural website analysis, as this www-foundation analysis may aim to illustrate. That content in itself might lead to desired effects is however but a necessary but certainly not a sufficient precondition for concluding that open data in this context has any effect. Such a conclusion would logically be spurious, as there is little or no causal evidence for such a link.

To turn to a specific Swedish example, all data on Sweden's development cooperation has been made available online as open data in a project called OpenAid. (http://www.openaid.se/) This is one of the larger investments in open data in Sweden. Officially, everyone is positive to the project, and media coverage is benevolent. (http://www.bistandsdebatten.se/category/alla-diskussioner/omtalade-personerkonflikterhandelser/webbplatsen-openaid-se/) However, off the record, associates of SIDA, the aid authority, say that the way data has been computerised, it actually makes it more difficult for them to audit various projects, thus impairing accountability. No-one would dare to say so officially though. So, in this case, open data may actually have been negative to at least accountability."
"Sweden","ODB.2013.I.ENV",4,"Environmental issues is actually one arena where a state authority has thoroughly thought through how to use and measure effect of open data.

In 2013, Naturvårdsverket, (http://www.naturvardsverket.se/) the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, won an award for their services within environmental open data. Designing their open data platform, the agency from the outset analysed what would be the desired effects of the new website, identifying user target groups and their needs, and also designing follow-up mechanisms to evaluate to what extent the website fulfilled its desired goals. http://www.edelegationen.se/Stod-och-verktyg/Inspiration/Bli-inspirerad-av-andra/Oppen-miljodata-for-okad-innovation-och-delaktighet/

There are a lot of actors, both puclic and private, that offer environmental open data, but what impact they have had is difficult to discern."
"Sweden","ODB.2013.I.INC",4,"Marginalised groups in Sweden are those who do not have access to modern ICT, such as the Internet. Government policies to generally increase Internet accessibility and penetration have actually increased the relative marginalisation of certain groups in society, e.g. as state subsidies have been linked to employment. This has shut out the unemployed and old age pensioners.

In 2010, .SE - the Internet Infrastructure Foundation - published a report stating that 1.7 million Swedes, 19% of the population, were effectively shut out of the Internet, and an additional 1.5 million (17%) have limited use of the web. In all, that would mean that internet use is low in some 36% of the population. https://www.iis.se/press/pressmeddelanden/17-miljoner-svenskar-star-utanfor-internet-ytterligare-15-miljoner-anvander-natet-mycket-begransat-2/"
"Sweden","ODB.2013.I.ECON",3,"There is little well-founded statistics readily available on what positive impact open data may have had on the economy. The Swedish e-delegation and Vinnova have alternately had the accountancy firm PWC do evaluations the benefits of open data, claiming that open data ""could have"" a positive economic growth effect of 10 billion Swedish crowns annually. This assumption is, however, a mere derivative of a European Union estimate on general positive economic effects of open data. As far as this question may be assessed, it seems that it is difficult for a researcher to evaluate if these figures are correct, as available documentation is problematic in terms of intersubjectivity, for a lack of proper definitions and references. 

As argued in a 2012 report, government agencies do not assess the potential third party economic gain of open data, and may therefore not make the right data available. http://www.janhylen.se/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/%C3%96ppna-l%C3%A4nkade-f%C3%B6retagsdata-C1.pdf
Below are a couple of links to analyses that claim open data have a positive economic impact.

http://www.pwc.se/sv_SE/se/publikationer/assets/pdf/oppna-data-i-sverige-2014-low.pdf
http://www.edelegationen.se/Documents/%C3%96vrigt/Oppna_data_-_Nytta_och_utmaningar_for_verksamheten.pdf

That this is an area with little analysis in Sweden is further exemplified by the state authority responsible for economic growth analysis, Tillvaxtanalys, lacks any economic assessment of open data economic benefits, with a mere report on general international observations, reiterating the assumption that open data is positive, whcih appears uncorroborated as for Swedish conditions. http://www.tillvaxtanalys.se/sv/publikationer/pm/working-paper-pm/2013-10-25-stora-data--oppna-data---exempel-pa-policyinitiativ-fran-asien-europa-och-usa.html

Still, there is a big however. Open data is used by numerous companies, where it forms the core of business ideas. It is apparent that open data drives business, and is something generally used by companies, besides those specialising in the area. That so little thorough statistics and analysis of the area is available, may actually be an effect of high integration of open data in both society and business. We are simply so used of having this sort of data before it became accessible online, that we do not think of the difference, because it is so natural."
"Sweden","ODB.2013.I.ENTR",5,"There is very scarce evidence that e.g. social entrepreneurs actually build new and successful businesses based on social data. This seems in contrast to what the government, and central and local authorities repeatedly state. Public administration to a large degree motivates open data because it is claimed to drive business. In reality, this researcher has found little evidence that this is actually the case, also by asking people active in this line of business. Public actor sources stating open data as business driver are many, but those indicating actual business are very few. Usually, those active in the business are consultants to authorities in constructing open data websites or applications for them, e.g. apps with traffic timetables, so it is mainly the public sector that both initiates and drives any business based on open data.

"Sweden","ODB.2013.C.DPL",9,"Sweden has for long had a very strict personal data act, originally by a 1973 law regulating the - not least computerized - use of personal data (cf. personal data law 1973:289). As the 1973 law was becoming increasingly outdated, given rapid technological developments, it was replaced in 1998 by a new personal data act, 1998:204, (http://www.sweden.gov.se/content/1/c6/01/55/42/b451922d.pdf), which also was in accordance with the European Union Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:en:HTML)."
"Sweden","ODB.2013.C.RTI",8,"In 1766, Sweden adopted the Press Freedom Act as part of the country's constitution (http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Lagar/Svenskforfattningssamling/_sfs-1949-105/). According to the Principle of Public Access, the public is guaranteed full and unimpeded access to all documentation on authorities' activities, unless particular documents are classified by law. Also, when official documents are classified, citizens may appeal for declassification, and in authorities must have clear legal motives for documents to remain classified. 

Furthermore, public employees are allowed to inform the press also about classified official acts and documents, without having to face legal sanctions.  Instead, authorities are explicitly banned from investigating an informer's identity, and if so happens, it is grounds for both dismissal and legal sanction.

In recent years, there is an ongoing discussion on the extent to which primarily Sweden's EU-membership and secondarily degenerative bureaucratic practices limit freedom of information (cf. eg. http://www.dn.se/debatt/offentlighetsprincipen-ar-pa-vag-att-vittra-sonder/)."

While there have been several open data events, such as 11 hackdays between 2011-2013 (2), sponsoring is in most cases provided by companies rather than the Swiss government. In some cases, however, public universities provide sponsoring, e.g., University of Geneva at the Law Mining Hackaton, 2013(3) and the University of Bern and the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland at the make.opendata.ch-Hackdays (4). The Swiss government funds studies on OGD, e.g.,(5). In general, it is less common in Switzerland that the government would directly provides financial support to such initiatives and activities; more often such financial means come from corporate sponsors. In that regards, it is not surprising to find fewer direct government activities in this area.

"Switzerland","ODB.2013.I.GOV",6,"Started in 2011/12, OGD is a relative young development in Switzerland. Thus, accurate sources that measure actual impact are difficult to obtain. To the researcher's knowledge, impact studies have not yet been conducted. However, the OGD Strategy Switzerland states that OGD will result in innovation and economic growth, transparency and participation, and efficiency gains in the public administration (1), (2). News media report that open data will create jobs. (3).Various OGD studies estimate significant benefits for the federal administration, e.g., in the domain of geo data, weather data, and environment data(4). An economic study reports that the overall economic benefits from OGD for Switzerland lie most likely between CHF0.9 B and CHF1.2 B (5).

What follows are a few open data examples and references to reports that make the case for an increase in government efficiency and effectiveness due to open data, particularly open government data:

- Budget 2012 Stadt Bern, is a web-enabled ICT that uses open data to visualize the City of Bern’s 2012 budget (6). It is mentioned in news papers as an example how open data increases transparency (7), (8).

- The study ‘Open Government Data Studie Schweiz’ (4) states that OGD supports the collaboration between different administrative entities and increases the quality of the public administration’s service portfolio (p 3; see also section “OGD als Förderer verwaltungsinterner Effizienz und Effektivität” on p 29).

- The study “Wirtschaftliche Auswirkungen von Open Government Data” (5) expects that ODG will simplify processes in the public administration (p 6), which leads to an increase in efficiency. 

- In a talk at the Collegium Generale at the University of Bern, M. Stürmer pointed at gains in effectiveness and efficiency due to ODG (9).

- A study about ODG for weather data/services at MeteoSchweiz implies that ODG will lead to even more efficient data management and services, which increases efficiency and potentially effectiveness in other areas (e.g. ODG users) (10).

The effects of OGD on transparency and accountability has been addressed at conferences, e.g., Stuermer (2012). Open Government Data für mehr Transparenz und Partizipation im öffentlichen Sektor, TEWI-Forum (1). Major media outlets have been reporting OGD and transparency, e.g., (2) and (3). There are multiple open data projects that contribute to the increase of transparency in various areas. Examples include: ‘Where Did My Taxes Go’ shows how paid taxes of an individual are allocated to various public domains (4). Bern’s Open Budget App visualizes the city’s expenses and income (5); similar apps are hold by the cities of Zurich (6) and Winterthur (7). The canton of Bern offers an app that visualizes its budget and fiscal equalization scheme (8). Other OGD apps incorporate data for accident statistics and health (9) while others encompass geo, telecom, and infrastructure information (10). All these information provides a new level of transparency and accountability.

"Switzerland","ODB.2013.C.DPL",8,"Switzerland has a robust legal framework for the protection of personal data. This includes the Data Protection Act (Datenschutzgesetz, DSG (1)) which regulates the use of personal data as well as the Federal Surveillance Act (Bundesgesetz über den Post- und Fernmeldeverkehr (2)) which sets out the rules for accessing personal data and other files by investigators. Personal use which does not lead to a disclosure is fully acceptable under the DSG. However, use by individuals and companies for commercial purposes is only allowed if the person to whom the data relates has disclosed the data knowing of the use to which the collector now wants to put it or has given his/her consent to the use of the data. The collector of the data has to take the necessary procedural steps to ensure the safety and protection of the data (3)

Further, Switzerland has several very active data protection/privacy commissioners on the federal (4) as well as the cantonal (e.g., in Zurich (5)) level. For annual activity reports of the federal data protection commissioner, see (6).

All the above, data experts says that Switzerland must update its outmoded data protection laws (currently 20 years old) to bring them in line with sweeping new European privacy regulations. (7)

"Switzerland","ODB.2013.C.RTI",6,"Switzerland has introduced its Right to Information (RTI) / Freedom of Information (FoI) law (referred to as ‘Öffentlichkeitsgesetz, BGÖ’) on the federal level, effective on July 1, 2006 (1). On the cantonal level, most cantons have established an equivalent law (2). The private platform www.oeffentlichkeitsgesetz.ch provides various services for the media and citizens to inform them about the Swiss transparency law and reports about current developments in that area (3).

The implementation of the BGÖ received considerable criticism. For instance: citizens do not know about its existence; administrative entities have not implemented it consistent with the letter of the law; and use a rather generous interpretation of the law in favor of the public administration. A parliamentary interpellation (4) addressed these issues and media outlets and civil society organizations reported about it: (5), (6), (7).

Further, Switzerland is on rank 59 on the current RTI rating, scoring 77 out of 150 points (on par with Rwanda). (8)

For example, there is no more need to go to the train station to obtain a train schedule, the citizen can have the information through a computer (2). 
The second determinant consists in a better control of administrative costs, and in particular salaries. In fact, there is no more need to recruit officers to inform citizens in public spaces (2,3).
Two problems were reported: not everybody has access to a computer, and many workers use the computers available in the working place, to navigate through opend data during time work, instead of working

The guidelines indicate that government entities should release data related to activities and services and make data releases available on organizational websites or portals for free in an easily accessible format (1). Open government data is currently centralized on the official portal of the UAE government, but there are plans for a dedicated portal. There has been explicit commitment to open data by several senior government officials including Ahmad Bin Humaidan, Director General of Dubai E-government (now Dubai Smart Government), and Salem Khamis Al Shair Al Suwaidi, Emirates E-government Director-General (2).

Over $4 million has been committed to the 2012-2014 Federal eGovernment strategy which includes an unspecified allocation towards open government (3). The recently introduced Dubai Smart Government’s Strategic Plan 2014-2017 specifically calls government entities to formulate a methodology for the open data and to build human resources capabilities for implementation (4). The first conference on open data in the Arab World convened in Abu Dhabi in April 2014 with the United Nations Division for Public Administration and Development Management and the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs also shows the UAE’s strong commitment to open data (5).

While mechanisms do exist for providing feedback on government service delivery, such as the Federal Feedback Gateway, citizen feedback and assessments of efficiency and effectiveness are not made available to the public nor are the resultant impacts of the feedback received and if it was used to make improvements. Therefore, it is difficult to establish a causal link between open data efforts and increases in government efficiency and effectiveness. In general, many of the open data sets available in the UAE focus on non-financial inputs or output indicators of public sector entities. This data does not enable external analysts to determine the efficiency or effectiveness of service delivery since outputs and outcomes are not linked to spending activity or detailed publicly available budgets. Measuring the impacts of public policy is a key weakness of Arab public sector institutions, and data is scarcely available across the region on policy level impacts."
"UAE","ODB.2013.I.ACCOUNT",3,"A prominent example of open data being used to increase government transparency and accountability is the release of school inspection data by the Knowledge and Human Development Authority in Dubai and other education regulators in the UAE. Data is publicly released on the overall quality of schools, their performance in certain key aspects of their work, and the performance of schools offering different curricula (1). The data helps to inform improvement planning at school and policy level as well as allows parents to make informed choices about the education choices for their children. Catalyzed by publically available statistics related to driving fatalities, the UAE has launched a number of awareness campaigns about road safety. Road safety initiatives address issues surrounding road safety and seatbelt usage to build broader awareness of the importance of driving safely. By providing an impetus to engage in social awareness campaigns about road safety, open data related to driving fatalities and pedestrian deaths has indirectly reduced rates of deaths related to traffic accidents. For example, statistics reflect a 9% reduction in pedestrian deaths, and a 24% reduction in road traffic accidents (2).

While there are several government and non-government organizations involved in environmental awareness programs and community action programs, activities are generally in areas such as energy consumption, marine debris, waste reduction, and paper consumption. These areas of intervention are not currently the focus of Ministry for Environment and Water open data releases, and, therefore, cannot be attributed to current environmental open data initiatives.

This includes widowed and divorced women, the disabled and the handicapped, orphans, single women, married students, and relatives of jailed individuals. In several Arab Gulf countries there are also high number of stateless individuals who live in countries without any paperwork or official status. There is no evidence to suggest that open data initiatives have had any impact on increasing the inclusion of such groups in policy making and accessing government services."
"UAE","ODB.2013.I.ECON",0,"There is no evidence of open data leading to positive economic impacts. One potential reason for this is that many public sector agencies in the UAE government have developed their own applications as an extension of public service delivery. While initiatives such as the Appfund, which funds mobile government application development, suggest a role for open data in generating enterprise creation, there are no examples of open data assisting the business community at this stage. It could even be argued that the government crowds out entrepreneurial initiatives in this sector by developing its own applications based on institutional data."

"UAE","ODB.2013.C.DPL",5,"There is no federal law that protects personal information in the UAE. However, a number of policies have broad applicability to the protection of private information by public and private sector entities. The principle of a right to privacy of personal information is codified in the UAE Constitution and is contained in a number of different UAE laws (1). If the collection and processing of any personal data pertains to an individual's private or family life, then the consent of the individual is required. A failure to obtain such consent would constitute a breach of the Penal Code (Article 378) and could also be a breach of the Cyber Crime Law if the personal data is obtained or processed through the internet or electronic devices in general (Articles 21 and 22) (2,3); the Telecoms Law if data is obtained through any means of telecommunication (Clause 3 Privacy of Consumer Information Policy) (4,5); or the Cyber Crime Law (Articles 12 and 13) if data is obtained through the internet or electronic devices. 

The UAE Labor Law places obligations on employers in relation to the information that they must maintain in respect of their employees (6). The UAE Credit Information Protection Law regulates the request, collection, preservation, analysis, classification, use, handling and protection of credit information (7). The UAE Medical Liability Law prohibits a doctor from disclosing the secrets of the patient that the doctor becomes aware of in the course of practice, either if the patient trusted him with the secret or if the doctor became aware of the secret in the course of practice (8). 

The right to access and correct records is generally enshrined as a provision in all the laws which relate to protection of personal data in the UAE. However, no specific federal laws specify the types of measures to be taken or level of security to prevent unauthorized disclosure of personal data (9). Many of the data privacy policies in the UAE have broad clauses related to taking measures to prevent use and disclosure of information but do not specify particular methods of compliance.  Similarly, many of the relevant data privacy laws have general clauses related to third party privacy. 

There is no mandatory requirement under UAE law to report data security breaches. Negligence in safeguarding private data can be pursued under the UAE Civil Code if breach has resulted in losses.  However, some laws, such as the Telecoms Law, do not include an explicit requirement on the part of service providers to take the initiative in notifying of a breach unless a person complains about unauthorized disclosure of personal data. 

Where the unauthorized disclosure of personal data results in a breach of the Penal Code, charges can be brought against the suspect in the Criminal Courts of First Instance. Pursuant to the Penal Code (Article 379), if the Courts find a suspect guilty of disclosing secrets that were entrusted to him ""by reason of his profession, craft, situation or art"" the penalties to be imposed under the Penal Code may include a fine of up to UAE Dirhams 20,000 (the fine is determined by the Courts) and an imprisonment for at least one year (Article 379). More generally, pursuant to the Penal Code (Article 378), ""a punishment of confinement and fine shall be inflicted on any person who attacks the sanctity of individuals' private or family life"" by committing any of the acts described under Article 378 ""other than the legally permitted cases or without the victim's consent."" (10)

Where the unauthorized disclosure of personal data results in a breach of the Cyber Crime Law, charges would be brought against the suspect in the Criminal Courts of First Instance. If found guilty of an offense under the Cyber Crime Law, the punishment an Offender can receive under the Cyber Crime Law varies depending on the nature of the crime. Punishments range from temporary detention, a minimum prison sentence of between six months or one year and/or a fine between AED 150,000 and 1,000,000 (Articles 2, 3, 7, 21
and 22 of the Cyber Crime Law). If found guilty of an attempt to commit any of the relevant offences under the Cyber Crime Law, the punishment is half the penalty prescribed for the full crime (Article 40).

Where the unauthorized disclosure of personal data results in a breach of the Telecoms Law and Policies, the subscriber/data subject generally needs to complain first to the service provider about the breach (Clause 3.1 Consumer Complaint and Dispute Procedure). After examining the complaint the Telecom Regulatory Authority may direct the service provider
""to undertake any remedy deemed appropriate"" to the subscriber/data subject (Clause 4.3 Consumer Complaint and Dispute Policy).

To summarise, thre is no comprehensive law is in place, although this source (11) does suggest reasonably good coverage by the laws that do exist.

Further, only 20% of government institutions have databases maintaining data of public interest and can be accessed externally by the public. And even then it did not meet the criteria for open data.

"Uganda","ODB.2013.C.CSOC",5,"The zeal with which civil society organizations, academia, government agencies and the donor community have been campaigning for more openness and information sharing in Uganda waned down in the last 12 months. This is mainly attributed to the required resources needed to sustain the campaign and the activism was largely restricted to the more prominent NGOs based in the capital city. Nonetheless, government agencies like National Planning Authority do recognize these organized campaigns and has been engaging in discussion with the CSO leaders on how to create awareness, advocacy and capacity building. 

The government is aware that some CSOs and international agencies like UNICEF are trying to open data and recognizes their efforts as pointed out by Julian Rwweju a Business Analyst at Directorate of E-Government. For instance, Text to Change recognizes the benefits of ‘open’ and has been sharing some of their data (1). The CSOs have gone as far as establishing the Uganda Open Development Partnership Platform to combine their knowledge to promote open development. However, the platform still needs assistance to be ready for the public. The available data sets and documents on the platform are released in proprietary formats, without the alternative of open formats. The Platform needs to be improved with the introduction of open license, multiple formats for material and structured data sets.

Besides, the Uganda Open Development Partnership Platform is challenged by regular funding and this is evidenced by the provision of data in an ad hoc manner and was last update over 14 months ago. The partnership is challenges by most of the data being in paper form or PDF, a lot of data is incomplete, of low quality, and some members fear to share their data anticipating that it might be used against them.

"Uganda","ODB.2013.C.RTI",4,"Uganda has a regulatory right to information law - the “Access to Information Act, 2005” that stipulates in Section 5 that “Every citizen has a right of access to information and records in the possession of the state or any public body, except where the release of the information is likely to prejudice the security or sovereignty of the state or interfere with the right to the privacy of any other person.” The Act goes on to specify the Information officers that shall be responsible for ensuring that records of the public body are accessible; the request form needed to access a record and how it should be filled in; assisting people that cannot fill in the request form; time taken to make decision on request and notice; what to do when request is granted or denied; and the types of records that cannot be accessed (1). To operationalise the Act, a statutory instrument “The Access to Information Regulations, 2007” was passed with the purpose of providing the procedure for accessing records from a public body (2).

Despite, the Act and Regulations being in place disclosure requirements are largely ineffective. Most government agencies report that they have never been provided with the Access Form. It is almost impossible to get information if one follows the stipulated channel. For instance, under this particular study the Access Form was never provided in any government MDA. In three cases where It was requested using the formal channels as requested by law, never got any information. In two places the response was that the person who is supposed to give out the information is not around and one should keep trying, and the other one promised to call back but never did. To-date no response have been received. It is easier to access information if one introduced themselves as a research student and it’s a bonus if you told them that you have all the information you need but there is this little bit you cannot find not even on internet. You are then sent to the Resource Center to see if you can get whatever record or data you want. If it is available, it’s usually at the cost of photocopying. If you did not inform them that you have checked out their website, some will direct you there, but very few have any useful information beyond their visions and missions. And when you try to use the “Contact Us” form, you never receive a response. If it necessitates a face to face interview, one is sent from one office to another because everybody is not the right person to divulge the information (3) (4). And in terms of types of information that can be easily accessed, legislative information like laws are the easiest to get. Statistical data is the hardest to get especially up-to-date statistics. Most institutions prefer face-to-face interviews but if not handled tactfully, respondents deliberately avoid giving relevant information as they keep basing their answers on a certain law. (5)

"UK","ODB.2013.C.INIT",10,"UK has excellent open government data initiative and is the largest resource of its kind in the world. The aim is to promote innovation though encouraging the use and re-use of government data-sets. Please refer to the parliament paper on open data (attached).

The UK Government has made a strong and explicit commitment to Open Government Data, starting under the Labour Government in 2009, and continued under the coalition government from 2010. A national data portal at data.gov.uk has been in place since early 2010.

The Prime Minister has issued letters to departments on opening data and there have been a series of white papers and strategies focussed on open data policy, including individual departmental open data strategies which are monitored through written ministerial statements. The Rt. Honorable Francis Maude was appointed Minister for the Cabinet Office and Paymaster General in May 2010 and has explicitly mandated the delivery.

The Guardian news quotes a Deloitte report on how we can understand the electoral behavior using open data (2). The news is a clear evidence to showcase the benefits of open data by civil society practices like improving transparency around the electoral process and stimulating increased democratic engagement.

The Open Data Immersion Programme (5) runs until the end of March 2015, bringing data owners and data users together. This brings SMEs, start-ups, data providers, industry experts and business leaders together to work on the idea of reuse of open data sets.

The UK Government has created an Open Data User Group (6)

In contrast, a report submitted in the parliament does not endorse the impact by open data by the government - ""There is little evidence to suggest that the Government is consistently making the most of the opportunities to improve policy and performance via the use of its own data. Departments need to make full use of the records and information they possess to ensure they are running effectively. Opening up that data to other departments will boost the Government's evidence base and can improve policy making. The benefits of making data open include not just an increase in openness and accountability, but also the opportunity for outside experts to verify, and suggest improvements in the quality and accuracy of, the data itself.""

UK is one of the foremost countries in the world that is making adequate progress in open data space. However, there is much more to be done.

"UK","ODB.2013.C.DPL",6,"UK has strict privacy law to protect identity of the individuals and organisations. However, there are loopholes in the law over the 'definition' of privacy and personal data. Compared to other countries in the world, UK law has existed in the U.K. for around 40 years is among the toughest ones.

The current law coming from 1998, based on needs identified in the early 1990s (5). As a result of technological progress, this law is now under review, partly because of the ways in which commercial organisations and the state can use customer profiling, digital forensics and search technology. Its scope is being questioned with regard to the definition of ""personal data,"" or data that identifies someone or that can allow identification when combined with other data.

Various initiatives such as the Open Data Initiative have come into being, with new use of data which is often derived from citizens. So the direction of data protection law is to ensure that it does not reduce the availability of information, but ensures that we have adequate protections in place.

The Information Commissioner's Office (4) is the UK’s independent authority set up to uphold information rights in the public interest, promoting openness by public bodies and data privacy for individuals.

The Freedom of Information Act gives you the right to ask any public sector organisation for recorded information they have on any subject. Anyone can make a request for information – with no restrictions on age, nationality or residence. Requests are handled under the Data Protection Act with no changes in the law since the period under consideration.

The right exists for any person, including legal entities such as companies. The right applies to any written or electronic request for information recorded in any form held by the authority at the time of the request, whether or not it explicitly mentions FOI.

However, there are a number of factors that weaken the implementation. Information can be refused on grounds of cost, vexatious requests, not in the public interest etc. It has been criticized for having the widest range of exemptions of all democratic states.

The agency in charge of regulating and enforcing protection of personal data is Agesic, through its Unidad Reguladora y de Control de Datos Personales. (Unit for Regulation and Control of Personal Data). According to major legal consultants in Uruguay the current legal framework is broadly applicable and has been increasingly applied in the past year. The law provides the right of choice/consent to individuals, provides the right to access and/or correct one's personal data, imposes clear responsibilities on information holders and provides a right of redress against both private and public bodies that violate data privacy.

"Uruguay","ODB.2013.C.RTI",8,"In Uruguay, RTI and FOI are upheld by law number 18381, passed in 2008. Citizens generally receive responses to requests for government information within a reasonable time period and at a reasonable cost, and responses are of acceptable quality. 

The law establishes reasonably fast times for processing information requests and sets a specific legal process to enforce it if information is not delivered in a timely manner. There is a clear political commitment to enforce RTI/FOI, involving the Presidency and including most of the Uruguayan state bodies and organizations. This right is actively used by the public, including members of the media and political parties. However, a few challenges and limitations remain: 1. Some companies, ruled by private right but which include public capital and/or public servants, are exempted from this law. This is the case as well for public-private associations. 2.the unit in charge of enforcing the law belongs to AGESIC and does not have its independent budget, nor has the ability to compel other institutions (this must be carried out by the aforementioned judicial process, which is simple but involves costs and requires legal counsel) 3. In 2013 a few modifications were introduced to the law, which widen the State's capacity to mark information as confidential. 

Despite these challenges, FOI/ROI has quickly been taken up by the Uruguayan society, and public bodies are adapting to it quickly, I
information requests are taken seriously and there is wide political support to its enforcement. Most requests are fulfilled correctly and on time.

She described the exemplary case where the communities that work around data.gov figured out that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service collected almost the same data. This was changed for a greater efficiency of data collection. Furthermore she gave an example where sharing data between government agencies reduced cost and improved efficiency (Jeanne sends evidence).

Due to the evidence presented there had been some efficiency improvement, however the collection of impact stories that is about to come up on data.gov will justify a higher score with higher confidence

There is one example where the U.S. Agency for International Development saved money by crowdsourcing a cleanup of there previously opened up datasets (1)

When asked for energy reduction of public buildings through Open Data she pointed to a report of the GSA Public Buildings Service, however a keyword search inside the document could not find any connection to open data (3).

"US","ODB.2013.I.INC",2,"As Jeanne Holm explained the US government is walking along several paths to include marginalized groups through Open Data. First they put all their information and code on Github and Stackexchange so everyone can access and reimplement it. Furthermore everyone can comment on the developments, the Open Data activities and strategy is quite deliberative and allows everyone who is online to participate. This includes people which are marginalized through their geographical location. For people who have a lower technology affinity, discussions with the government are possible through G+ or other social networks as well. To tackle the digital divide the team of data.gov organizes offline events in local schools and works with them to include Open Data into the curriculum.

There have been several regional applications developed that help marginalized people to access government services. In LA there is an app that connects homeless shelters with restaurants and stores to relocate food leftovers. Open data is used to identify the locations of shelters or the health inspection scores of relevant restaurants. Furthermore there are apps which connect department stores with shelters or which give an overview of the recovery rates and services of hospitals (also relevant for homeless). (1,2)

There have been some efforts on regional level, but obviously there is potential. However you should also notice that within the United States there are not as many people classified as marginalized as in other less developed countries so including them is less of a ""low hanging fruit"".

"US","ODB.2013.C.DPL",5,"The US has the Privacy Act of 1974 (1), which governs personal information maintained by federal agencies.
The  Act  outlines the laws in the US relating to Data Protection, and strives to achieve four basic policy objectives:
(1) To restrict disclosure of personally identifiable records maintained by agencies.
(2) To grant individuals increased rights of access to agency records maintained on 
themselves.
(3) To grant individuals the right to seek amendment of agency records maintained on 
themselves upon a showing that the records are not accurate, relevant, timely, or 
complete.
(4) To establish a code of “fair information practices” which requires agencies to 
comply with statutory norms for collection, maintenance, and dissemination of records.

 It also has a data protection agency, the Federal Trade Commission and is a member of several international associations of data protection agencies (eg ICDPPC; GPEN; APPA; APEC CPEA).
Other US legislation on data protection has been passed on an ad hoc or sectoral basis when a specific need arises ( eg the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988 (3), the Cable Television Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (4), the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the 2010 Massachusetts Data Privacy Regulations.

According to the Service GovTrack.us there is the ""Personal Data Protection and Breach Accountability Act of 2014"" under discussion. This bill was assigned to a congressional committee on February 4, 2014, which will consider it before possibly sending it on to the House or Senate as a whole. (5)

However, ""agencies"" in this law only refers to the public sector and this law does not apply to the private sector, thus not fulfilling the criteria of broad applicability. According to a 2012 paper by Graham Greenleaf, ""The US is one of only two countries that ""still provide basic data privacy protection in relation to their public sector only ... but do not do so for their private sector."" Consumers have little control over their personal data in the face of private companies and few options for redress in cases of privacy invasion.(2)

According to an article in the Wall Street Journal, ""Sensitive health information gleaned from the websites we visit is collected and sold, GPS and cell-signal location tracking by the police is conducted without warrants, and online retailers target consumers for higher prices based on their Web browsing histories. Industry self-regulation and options like privacy settings on social networks, Web browsers and mobile apps have failed to keep up with advances in invasive tracking techniques. Our limited legal rights don't come close to protecting us against online tracking and profiling."" (source: Joel R. Reidenberg. Wall Street Journal.

In a letter to US government leaders, a coalition of more than a dozen American advocacy groups says: ""Our personal data -­‐-­ our privacy -­‐-­ is being abused by both the commercial sector and governments.

In February 2014 the  FOIA Oversight and Implementation Act of 2014 (H.R. 1211; 113th Congress) passed the US House of representatives.

The Law against Informatics Crimes (Ley contra los Delitos Informáticos) protects privacy of data, granting confidentiality, inviolability and secrecy of communications (2). This law establishes three to five years of imprisonment to the person registering and disclosing private communications. However, despite the complaints, such protection is not been enforced currently and violations are not investigated or punished. On 2012 and 2013, there were several cases of hacking of Twitter and emails accounts of journalists, internet rights activists, and Union leaders. A group called N33 claimed on government-run TV channel that they hacked such accounts. They were never prosecuted (3) (4) (5).  

Moreover, last year was created the CESPPA, a national security office reporting to the President of the Republic, who has power to block personal communications in the web without judicial authorization on matters deemed to affect the State strategic interests (6). On 2010, a similar agency, the CESNA, was created, but the Supreme Justice Court ruled that it violates Constitutional rights (7). After the Court ruling, the CESNA was eliminated.

The law also bans content which could be “harmful” to national security or which opposes the government.

"Zimbabwe","ODB.2013.C.DPL",4,"Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act Chapter 10:27 was enacted to protect personal privacy (1). According to Section 29 of the Act,
""A public body may only collect personal information if—
(a) the collection of that information is expressly authorized in terms of an enactment;
(b) the information is to be collected for the purposes of national security, public order and
law enforcement; or
(c) the information is to be collected for the purposes of public health; or
(d) the information relates directly to and is necessary for an operating programme, function
or activity of the public body;
(e) the information will be used to formulate public policy"". Section 30 of the act stipulates that any public body shall inform a person from whom it intends to collect personal information of the purpose for which the personal information is being collected and the legal authority for collecting it (2).
However, some key best-practice elements are missing.
