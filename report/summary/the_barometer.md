# Introduction:

<span class="lead">The core idea behind Open Government Data (OGD) is a simple one: public data should be a shared resource. It is not only valuable to the government departments that collect it, but also has value for citizens, entrepreneurs and other parts of the public sector. </span>

However, moving from the idea of OGD, to its implementation, takes dedicated and sustained policy attention. Widespread impacts from open data release rely upon not only on the supply of high-quality data, but also upon the capacity of users to work with data, and the ability of government to engage proactively with those users. 

In our complex world, securing government accountability, coordinating action to improve society, and bootstrapping new business ideas can all benefit from access to government data. Yet far too often, access to data, and the skills to use it, are unequally distributed, and there are unnecessary technical and legal restrictions that prevent its use. With calls for a [data revolution](http://www.undatarevolution.org) placing renewed attention on ensuring the collection and management of high quality data around the world through strengthened statistical capacity and through using new big data collection methods, questions of who has access to that data, and whether citizens have the freedom and ability to create, access and analyse data about their own communities and concerns in becoming even more important. 

## The Open Data Barometer
This report brings together the results of expert survey research, technical assessments of data supply, and secondary data, in order to contribute to deeper understandings of the global landscape of open data. It looks at:

* **Readiness** to secure benefits from open data: including the legal, political, economic, social, organisational and technical foundations in countries that can support the supply and use of open data. 

* **Implementation** of open data practice, measured through the openness of 15 key categories of data, and the adoption for those datasets of common practices as set out in the [Open Definition](http://opendefinition.org/), and [Open Government Data Principles](http://opengovdata.org/).

* **Impacts** of open data, measured through media and academic mentions of data use and impact.

As the second edition of the Open Data Barometer this report broadly replicates the methodology used in 2013. It draws on updated research inputs covering the 2013-2014 period, and adds nine new countries to the sample. There are also some minor updates to some question definitions and sub-component weightings. By repeating the 2013 methodology we allow for comparisons to be made between data from the two years, and support an assessment of global and local trends, as well as generating key learning to help improve future open data measurement activities. As the open data field, and with it the Open Data Barometer, continues to develop in future years, we will be drawing further upon the [common assessment framework for open data](http://opendataresearch.org/sites/default/files/posts/Common%20Assessment%20Workshop%20Report.pdf), developed by the Web Foundation, GovLab and other partners, placing greater emphasis in particular on impacts, and upon evidence of open data use (as an important mediating variable between readiness/data availability and impact). 

The following sections of this report present selected statistics and commentary based on our data collection, as well as offering a composite ranking of countries. However, this report is just one part of the Open Data Barometer. By providing the underlying data gathered during the project we encourage other advocates, scholars and practitioners to draw upon it to ask further research questions, and to refine shared understanding of how to achieve positive impacts from open data. 

## Defining open data
The last year has witnessed growing concern, and confusion, about the boundaries between personal or private data, and open data. As citizens have grown more aware of the ways in which surveillance agencies and corporations have abused their personal data, or have seen mistakes made by government in publishing inappropriately anonymised data[^1], trust in government data handling has been undermined. And as governments have sought to make better use of the records they hold on individual citizens, or to engage with big data, they have often clouded the distinction between 'data sharing' (where there can still be restrictions on who can use the data, and what for), and 'open data', which should be accessible for anyone to re-use for any purpose. It is important therefore to draw clear definitions and distinctions.

When we discuss open data in this report, we are discussing data that is:

* **Accessible** - by being proactively published, and being made available without charge.

* **Machine-readabile** - by being published in file formats and structures that allow computers to extract and process the data: sorting, filtering and searching through the contents.

* **Re-usable** - by being made available under legal regimes or explicit terms that place a minimum of restrictions on how the data may be used. At most the publisher can specify how the source should be acknowledged. 

These principles are conventionally operationalised by checking whether data is online, in specified file formats, and provided with explicit license terms. In assessing whether datasets quality as 'open data' we follow this approach, but we also collect other important variables about the timeliness, sustainability and discoverability of datasets - recognising that there are important social, as well as technical and legal aspects of openness. 

#### Private data and public records
By definition, open data should not include **private data**. Private data should have a limited distribution, and any restrictions on distribution go against the re-usability terms of open data. In general, this means that the records government holds on individuals should not be made available as open data **unless** these records are understood to be part of the **public record**. For example, the names of company directors may be part of the public record, and so could be released as open data. Providing public records as open data, including records that contain information about individuals, does not invalidate other obligations on potential users of the data to abide by existing legal frameworks for data protection. This highlights the importance of linking open data regulations and laws designed to increase transparency, with privacy protection laws and frameworks that can restrict certain abusive uses of the data. Even with these frameworks in place, there are some datasets where the risk of the data being re-identified, or personal information contained within it abused, is such that it cannot be 'open by default'. 

The Open Data Barometer explicitly surveys the existence of data protection laws in each country, and considers their existence and strength as a component of open data readiness.

## Key facts: methodology

The Open Data Barometer is based upon three kinds of data:

* **A peer reviewed expert survey** carried out between May and September 2014, asking researchers to provide a score from 0 – 10 in response to a range of questions about open data contexts, policy, implementation and impacts. Scores were normalised (using z-scores) prior to inclusion in the Barometer.

* **Detailed dataset survey** completed by a team of technical experts. These assessments were based on a 10-point checklist, completed for 15 kinds of data in each country, touching on issues of data availability, format, license, timeliness and discoverability. Initial source information for locating datasets, and the agencies responsible for their production, were provided by the expert survey, and then validated by the technical experts. Each answer in the 10-point checklist is supported by qualitative information and detailed hyperlinks, and checklist responses are combined in a weighted aggregation to provide a 0 – 100 score for each dataset. These are presented in their original form, to allow comparison between datasets, and are averaged to give a dataset implementation sub-index. This sub-index is normalised (using z-scores) prior to inclusion in the overall Barometer calculations.

* **Secondary data** selected to complement our expert survey data. This is used in the readiness section of the Barometer, and is taken from the World Economic Forum, United Nations e-Government Survey, and Freedom House. The data is normalised using z-scores prior to inclusion in the Barometer. 

The list of countries included in the 2014 Barometer is based upon [the Web Index](http://www.thewebindex.org) sample, which was designed to represent a broad range of different regions, political systems and levels of development.
