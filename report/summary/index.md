# Key findings

<span class="lead">Action is needed to close the growing data divide, and to guarantee that the benefits of open data will be available to all.</span>

This second edition of the Open Data Barometer presents a picture of steady growth of data supply and use in leading countries, whilst many others are being left behind, lacking key capacities to produce, share and use open data. Overall, the entrepreneurial use of open data has overtaken transparency and accountability as the widest perceived area of impacts, and evidence of social or environmental impacts from open data remains scarce. As the UN leads a conversation on the need for a '[Data Revolution](http://www.undatarevolution.org)' to support the [Post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals](http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015.html), our research highlights the lack of open and accessible data on the performance of key public services. If the political and social impacts of open data are to be realised, work is needed to increase the supply of datasets from right across government, alongside sustained investment in all sectors on capacity building, training and support for effective data use.

## In detail

This second edition of the Barometer covers 86 countries, representing a wide range of political, social and economic circumstances. From this sample, we find that:

* Countries with well resourced open data initiatives with senior level government backing are much more likely to see open data impacts, indicating that, as they become established, initiatives do provide a return on effort and investment. 

* Much more needs to be done to support data-enabled democracy around the world. There has been very limited expansion of the transparency and accountability impact of open data over the last year, and too few governments are providing timely access to performance data on public services. This limits the ability of citizens to engage in shaping and monitoring policy, undermining one of the key opportunities of open data. 

* For greatest impacts, open data needs go local. Political impacts from open data are greater in countries that have city-level open data activities, not just national initiatives. Widespread availability of data skills training is also correlated with higher political impact.

* Global progress towards embedding open data policies stalled in 2014. Whilst many countries with moderate or strong initiatives in 2013 saw steady growth in the strength of their open data policies, a number of countries made substantial backwards steps, and many countries which made initial steps with open data in 2012/13 have not been sustained their open data activities. Government that is 'open by default' is a long way off for most of the world's citizens. 

* A small number of countries are moving towards requiring proactive disclosure of government data as part of their Right to Information laws - effectively, establishing a Right to Data. However in most countries open data policies continue to lack legislative backing. The continued weakness of data protection laws, particularly in light of continued revelations and concerns about data-mining by corporations and states, is a cause for concern. 

* Just over 10% of the 1290 different datasets surveyed for the Barometer were published as full open data in bulk, machine-readable formats and under open licenses. This represents a small but significant increase from 7% of datasets in 2013. 31 countries have at least one open dataset, and amongst the top 11 ranked countries just over 50% of their datasets surveyed qualified as fully open data.

## Country by country analysis
    
Based on a statistical cluster analysis of all the variables in the Open Data Barometer, we divide the countries studied into four groups:
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-8" markdown="1">
* **High capacity** - These countries all have established open data policies, often with strong political backing. They have extended a culture of open data out beyond a single government department and open data practices are adopted in different government agencies, and increasingly at a local government level. These countries tend to adopt a common approach to open data, incorporating key principles of the open definition, and emphasising issues of open data licensing. They have government, civil society and private sector capacity to benefit from open data. 

    Countries included in this cluster in ODB rank order are: UK, US, Sweden, France, New Zealand, Netherlands, Canada, Norway, Denmark, Australia, Germany, Finland, Estonia, Korea, Austria, Japan, Israel, Switzerland, Belgium, Iceland and Singapore

<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-8" markdown="1">
* **Emerging & advancing** - These countries have emerging or established open data programmes, often as dedicated initiatives, but sometimes through linking open data ideas into existing policy agendas. Many of these countries are innovating in the delivery of open data policy, contextualising open data for their populations. For example, focussing on the need for governments to make data accessible through visualisation in contexts of limited literacy and data literacy, such as in India, or exploring the linkages between Right to Information laws and open data, as in the Philippines. The countries in this cluster have a variety of different strengths - and have great potential to develop innovative approaches to open data. However, many still face challenges before open data is mainstreamed across government and institutionalised as a sustainable practice. 

    Countries included in this cluster, in ODB rank order, are: Spain, Chile, Czech Republic, Brazil, Italy, Mexico, Uruguay, Russia, Portugal, Greece, Ireland, Hungary, Peru, Poland, Argentina, Ecuador, India, Colombia, Costa Rica, South Africa, Tunisia, China, Philippines and Morocco

</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-8" markdown="1">
* **Capacity constrained** - The countries in this cluster all face challenges in establishing sustainable open data initiatives as a result of limited government, civil society or private sector capacity, limits on affordable widespread Internet access, and weaknesses in digital data collection and management. A small number of the countries in this cluster, such as Kenya, Ghana and Indonesia, have established open data initiatives, but these remain highly dependent upon a small network of leaders and technical experts. Without sustained leadership and investment, moves towards open data are difficult to make sustainable, as Kenya's dramatic fall in the Barometer rankings demonstrates. Limited availability of relevant training and technical capacity for working with open data presents an extra challenge for these countries to overcome in developing the availability and use of open data. There is an urgent need for more appropriate models of education and capacity building that can support nascent community and government-led open data initiatives. These countries are most in need of a comprehensive data revolution, including, in many countries, attention to basics of Internet connectivity, as well as data literacy. 

    Countries included this cluster, in ODB rank order, are: Indonesia, Turkey, Ghana, Rwanda, Jamaica, Kenya, Mauritius, Ukraine, Thailand, Vietnam, Mozambique, Jordan, Nepal, Egypt, Uganda, Pakistan, Benin, Bangladesh, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania, Venezuela, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, Zambia, Yemen, Cameroon, Mali, Haiti, Myanmar

<div class="col-sm-8" markdown="1">
* **One sided initiatives** - These countries each have some form of open data initiative, ranging from departmental web pages listing open data, to full open data portals. However, government action to publish selected datasets is not matched by civil society capacity and freedom to engage with the data, nor by private sector involvement in the open data process. As a result, these initiatives appear to be very supply-side driven, without engagement with a broad community of users. Without wider political freedoms, the potential of open data to bring about political and social change in these contexts will be limited. 

    The countries in this cluster, in ODB rank order, are: Malaysia, Kazakhstan, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar

Different strategies will be needed in each cluster in order to develop and deepen effective open data practice. Whilst the 'big tent' of open data, the well networked open data community, and the availability of shared guides, tools and technologies, have all helped the open data concept to spread rapidly, there is no single 'best practice' for delivering an open data initiative. Continued innovation and evaluation is needed to find best fit approaches to apply in relation to different countries, communities, datasets and goals for open data policy.


The rest of this report looks in depth at different aspects of the open data landscape, before providing an aggregated ranking of country performance on readiness, implementation and impact.
