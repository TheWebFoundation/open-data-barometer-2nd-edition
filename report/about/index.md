## About the Open Data Barometer
The Open Data Barometer aims to uncover the true prevalence and impact of open data initiatives around the world. It analyses global trends, and provides comparative data on countries and regions via an in-depth methodology combining contextual data, technical assessments and secondary indicators to explore multiple dimensions of open data readiness, implementation and impact. 

This is the second edition of the Open Data Barometer, completing a two-year pilot of the Barometer methodology, and drawing on broadly the same indicators as in 2013 to allow for comparative research. This report is just one expression of the Barometer, for which full data is also available, supporting secondary research into the progression of open data policies and practices across the world. 

The Open Data Barometer forms part of the World Wide Web Foundationâ€™s work on common assessment methods for open data. 

## About the Web Foundation
The [World Wide Web Foundation](http://www.webfoundation.org) was established in 2009 by Web inventor, Sir Tim Berners-Lee. Our mission? To advance the open Web as a public good and a basic right.
 
Thanks to the Web, for the first time in history we can glimpse a society where everyone, everywhere has equal access to knowledge, voice and the ability to create. In this future, vital services such as health and education are delivered efficiently, access to knowledge unlocks economic value whilst access to information enhances transparency and strengthens democracy.
 
To achieve this vision, the Web Foundation operates at the confluence of technology, research and development, targeting three key areas: Access, Rights and Participation. Our work on open data connects across these themes, working to support inclusive approaches to open data impact across the globe.
