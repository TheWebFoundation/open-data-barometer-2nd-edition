# Executive Summary

<span class="lead">Action is needed to close the growing data divide, and to guarantee that the benefits of open data will be available to all.</span>

This second edition of the Open Data Barometer presents a picture of steady growth of data supply and use in leading countries, whilst many others are being left behind, lacking key capacities to produce, share and use open data. The entrepreneurial use of open data has overtaken transparency and accountability as the widest perceived area of impacts, and evidence of social or environmental impacts from open data remains lacking. As the UN leads a conversation on the need for a 'Data Revolution' to support the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals, our research highlights the lack of accessible and open data on the performance of key public services. If the political and social impacts of open data are to be realised, work to increase the supply of datasets from across government will be needed, as will investment in capacity building and training for data use.

This year's report covers 86 countries, representing a wide range of political, social and economic circumstances. From this sample, we find that:

* Much more needs to be done to support data-enabled democracy around the world. There has been very limited expansion of the transparency and accountability impact of open data over the last year, and too few governments are providing timely access to performance data on public services, 
limiting the ability of citizens to engage in shaping and monitoring policy. 

* Countries with strong open data initiatives are much more likely to see open data impacts, indicating that, as they become established, initiatives do provide a return on effort and investment. 

* Just over 10% of the 1290 different datasets surveyed for the Barometer were published as full open data in bulk, machine-readable formats and under open licenses. This represents a small but significant increase from 7% of datasets in 2013. 30 countries have at least one open dataset, and amongst the top 11 ranked countries just over 50% of their datasets surveyed qualified as fully open data.

* Global progress towards embedding open data policies stalled in 2014. Whilst many countries with moderate or strong initiatives in 2013 saw steady growth in the strength of their open data policies, a number of countries made substantial backwards steps, and many countries which made initial steps with open data in 2012/13 have not been sustained their open data activities. Government that is 'open by default' is a long way off for most of the world's citizens. 

* A small number of countries are making promising moves towards establishing a 'Right to Data', and better linking Right to Information (RTI). However in most countries open data policies continue to lack legislative backing. The continued weakness of data protection laws, particularly in light of continued revelations and concerns about data-mining by corporations and states, is a cause for concern. 

* Support for innovation in the use of open data plays an important role in enabling impacts: both economic and social. There are also indications from the study that political impacts are correlated with city level open data activities, and the widespread availability of data skills training in both higher education and specialist courses.

Based on a statistical cluster analysis of all the variables in the Open Data Barometer, we divide the 86 countries in this report into four groups:

* **High capacity** - These countries all have established open data policies, often with strong political backing. They have extended a culture of open data out beyond a single government department, to see the adoption of open data practices in different government agencies and increasingly at a local government level. These countries tend to adopt a common approach to open data, incorporating key principles of the open definition, and emphasising issues of open data licensing. They have government, civil society and private sector capacity to benefit from open data. Countries included in this cluster in ODB rank order are: UK, US, Sweden, France, New Zealand, Netherlands, Canada, Norway, Denmark, Australia, Germany, Finland, Estonia, Korea, Austria, Japan, Israel, Switzerland, Belgium, Iceland and Singapore

* **Emerging & advancing** - These countries have emerging or established open data programmes, drawing on a combination of mainstream approaches, and also linking open data ideas into existing national policy agendas. Many of these countries are innovating in the delivery of open data policy, contextualising open data for their populations. For example, focussing on the need for governments to make data accessible through visualisation in low literacy / data literacy contexts, such as in India, or exploring the linkages between Right to Information laws and open data, as in the Philippines. The countries in this cluster have a variety of different strengths - and have great potential to develop innovative approaches to open data. However, many still face challenges before open data is mainstreamed across government and institutionalised as a sustainable practice. Countries included in this cluster, in ODB rank order, are: Spain, Chile, Czech Republic, Brazil, Italy, Mexico, Uruguay, Russia, Portugal, Greece, Ireland, Hungary, Peru, Poland, Argentina, Ecuador, India, Colombia, Costa Rica, South Africa, Tunisia, China, Philippines and Morocco

* **Capacity constrained** - The countries in this cluster all face challenges in establishing sustainable open data initiatives as a result of limited government, civil society or private sector capacity, limits on affordable widespread Internet access, and weaknesses in data collection and management. A small number of the countries in this cluster, such as Kenya, Ghana and Indonesia, have established open data initiatives, but these remain highly dependent upon a small network of leaders and technical experts. Without sustained leadership and investment, moves towards open data are difficult to make sustainable. Limited availability of relevant training and technical capacity for working with open data presents an extra challenge for these countries to overcome in developing the availability and use of open data, and there is a need for more appropriate models of education and capacity building to support nascent community and government-led open data initiatives. These countries are most in need of a comprehensive data revolution, including, in many countries, attention to basics of Internet connectivity, as well as data literacy. Countries included this cluster, in ODB rank order, are: Indonesia, Turkey, Ghana, Rwanda, Jamaica, Kenya, Mauritius, Ukraine, Thailand, Vietnam, Mozambique, Jordan, Nepal, Egypt, Uganda, Pakistan, Benin, Bangladesh, Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania, Venezuela, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, Zambia, Yemen, Cameroon, Mali, Haiti, Myanmar

* **One sided initiatives** - These countries each have some form of open data initiative, ranging from departmental web pages listing open data, to full open data portals. However, government action to publish selected datasets is not matched by civil society capacity and freedom to engage with the data, nor by private sector involvement in the open data process. As a result, these initiatives appear to be very supply-side driven, without engagement with a broad community of users. Without wider political freedoms, the potential of open data to bring about political and social change in these contexts will be limited. The countries in this cluster, in ODB rank order, are: Malaysia, Kazakhstan, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar

Different strategies will be needed in each cluster in order to develop and deepen effective open data practice. Whilst the 'big tent' of open data, the densely networked open data community, and the availability of shared guides, tools and technologies, have all helped the open data concept to spread rapidly, there is no single 'best practice' for delivering an open data initiative, and continued innovation and evaluation is needed to find 'best fit' approaches to different countries, communities, datasets and ultimately goals for open data policy.
