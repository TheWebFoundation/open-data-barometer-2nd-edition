The last 12 months have seen continued policy attention on open data across the world, with OGD initiatives launched and strengthened in a number of different countries. Through their Open Government Partnership National Action Plans, 41 governments have made over 135 open data related commitments[^1].

Thematic open data projects also continue to gain ground, from the [Global Open Data Initiative on Agriculture and Nutrition](http://www.godan.info), to the development of an [Open Contracting Data Standard](http://standard.open-contracting.org). Global civil society networks are increasingly looking at how to join up datasets to '[follow the money](http://followthemoney.net/)' and secure accountability. Yet, major barrier exist in terms of data quality, timeliness and a dearth of common standards and identifiers, along with the limited openness of vital linking datasets such as company registries.
